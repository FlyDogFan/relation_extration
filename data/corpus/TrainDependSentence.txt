C_D009270 reverses the antiD_D006973 effect of C_D003000. 
C_D009270 reverses the antiD_D006973 effect of C_D003000. 
In unanesthetized, spontaneously D_D006973 rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous C_D003000, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by C_-1, 0.2 to 2 mg/kg. 
The D_D007022 effect of 100 mg/kg C_D008750 was also partially reversed by C_D009270. 
The D_D007022 effect of 100 mg/kg C_D008750 was also partially reversed by C_D009270. 
In brain membranes from spontaneously D_D006973 rats C_D003000, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-C_D009270 (8 nM), and C_D009270, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence C_D003000-suppressible binding of C_-1 (1 nM).

C_D008012-induced D_D006323. 
Intravenous administration of a single 50-mg bolus of C_D008012 in a 67-year-old man resulted in profound D_D003866 of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers. 
The patient had no apparent associated conditions which might have predisposed him to the development of D_D001919; and, thus, this probably represented a true idiosyncrasy to C_D008012.

C_D008094thium also caused D_D011507 and systolic D_D006973 in absence of D_D005921. 
HP failed to accentuante progression of D_D051437 and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma C_D003404 levels in C_D008094 pretreated rats. 
HP failed to accentuante progression of D_D051437 and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma C_D003404 levels in C_D008094 pretreated rats. 
The results indicate that C_D008094-induced D_D007674, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with D_D011507 and arterial systolic D_D006973.

Treatment of D_D003424 with C_D005672: an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to C_D016572. 
Treatment of D_D003424 with C_D005672: an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to C_D016572. 
Because of the need for the development of new treatments for D_D003424, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of C_D005672 treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients. 
The results of this pilot study suggest that C_D005672 may be of benefit in selected chronic active D_D003424 patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective. 
Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of C_D005672 at the cytokine level in D_D015212, we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated.

C_D013469-induced D_D004421. 
Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects, C_D013469-induced D_D004409 and D_D010302 have been reported occasionally. 
Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects, C_D013469-induced D_D004409 and D_D010302 have been reported occasionally. 
We studied a 37-year-old man who developed persistent segmental D_D004421 within 2 months after starting C_D013469 therapy. 
We could not find any previous reports of C_D013469-induced D_D004421.

Ocular and auditory D_D064420 in hemodialyzed patients receiving C_D003676. 
During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving C_D003676 (10-40 mg/kg BW/3 times weekly) for the first time were monitored for detection of D_D014786|D006311. 
C_D003676 withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3, and a complete reversal of D_D034381 in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3. 
This D_D064420 appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of C_D003676 or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or C_-1 serum levels. 
The data indicate that D_D014786|D006311 is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving C_D003676.

D_D009157 presenting as weakness after C_D008274 administration. 
We studied a patient with no prior history of D_D009468 who became virtually D_D011782 after parenteral C_D008274 administration for D_D011225. 
We studied a patient with no prior history of D_D009468 who became virtually D_D011782 after parenteral C_D008274 administration for D_D011225. 
We studied a patient with no prior history of D_D009468 who became virtually D_D011782 after parenteral C_D008274 administration for D_D011225. 
Although D_D010243 after C_D008274 administration has been described in patients with known D_D009157, it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease. 
Although D_D010243 after C_D008274 administration has been described in patients with known D_D009157, it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease. 
Patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of C_D008274 should be suspected of having an underlying D_D020511.

The data demonstrate that C_C004656 after i.v. administration does not contribute to D_D001745. 

passage:2515254
Twenty common D_D008881 patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of C_D005996 (10 patients) or placebo ointment (10 patients) in a double blind study. 
Early onset D_D008881 attacks were induced by C_D005996 in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group. 
Subsequently 20 D_D008881 patients, who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal C_D005996, received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas. 
Thus the D_D008881-inducing effect of C_D005996 seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of D_D010146, suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a D_D008881 crisis.

The administration of several C_D001569, chemically related to C_C084599, did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of D_D056486. 
The administration of several C_D001569, chemically related to C_C084599, did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of D_D056486. 
This observation shows that C_C084599 can induce acute D_D056486 and suggests that there is no cross D_D056486 between C_C084599 and several C_D001569.

Arterial D_D006973 as a complication of prolonged C_D007654 treatment. 
Two of 14 patients with D_D003480 treated on a long-term basis with C_D007654 developed sustained D_D006973. 
Two of 14 patients with D_D003480 treated on a long-term basis with C_D007654 developed sustained D_D006973. 
In both cases normal plasma and urinary free C_D006854 levels had been achieved following C_D007654 therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated D_D006973 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment. 
In both cases normal plasma and urinary free C_D006854 levels had been achieved following C_D007654 therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated D_D006973 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment. 
Our findings show that long-term treatment with high doses of C_D007654 may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid-related D_D006973.

D_D007674 as reflected by an increase in serum C_D014508 and in kidney weight was prevented by C_D002216. 
D_D007674 as reflected by an increase in serum C_D014508 and in kidney weight was prevented by C_D002216. 
C_D002216 may, by the same mechanism, reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli, with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less D_D007674 will be produced.

Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of C_D009020 (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced D_D009127 recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. 
Rats treated for 11 days with C_D009020 and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a D_D009127 after the test dose of C_D009020 that was not significantly less than in the controls and were D_D018476 (A group). 
Rats treated for 11 days with C_D009020 and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a D_D009127 after the test dose of C_D009020 that was not significantly less than in the controls and were D_D018476 (A group). 
In a further series of experiments, C_D006220 (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the D_D009127 without any dopaminergic interference. 
C_D006220 enhanced the D_D009127 in the A group. 
The results suggest that D_D009127, which is assumed to be due to an action of C_D009020 in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum.

Changes in heart size during long-term C_D013999 treatment after D_D009203. 
The effect of long-term C_D013999 treatment on heart size after D_D009203 was evaluated by X-ray in a double-blind study including 241 patients (placebo 126, C_D013999 115). 
These differences may be caused by C_D013999-induced D_D001919 and a compensatory increase in end-diastolic volume. 
After re-D_D007238, heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the C_D013999 group.

Large parenteral doses of C_D002762 (15 to 17.5 x 10(6) IU C_D002762) were associated with prolonged D_D006934, D_D054559, and large increases of C_D002762 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows. 
Large parenteral doses of C_D002762 (15 to 17.5 x 10(6) IU C_D002762) were associated with prolonged D_D006934, D_D054559, and large increases of C_D002762 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows. 
None of the cows treated with C_D002762 showed signs of D_D010319 during the peripartal period; however, 22% of the control cows developed clinical signs of D_D010319 during this period. 
Signs of C_D002762 D_D064420 were not observed in nonlactating nonpregnant cows; however, pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of C_D002762 D_D064420 and 10 of 17 cows died. 
Because of the extreme D_D064420 of C_D002762 in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of C_D002762 that prevent D_D010319 and doses that induce D_D010319, we concluded that C_D002762 cannot be used practically to prevent D_D010319 when injected several weeks prepartum.

C_D014859-induced D_D061205 is accelerated by growth and C_D014807. 
C_D014859-induced D_D061205 is accelerated by growth and C_D014807. 
The present studies demonstrate that growth and C_D014807 treatment enhance the extent of D_D061205 in rats given sufficient doses of C_D014859 to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a D_D002114 inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall.

The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on D_D061205 in C_D014859-treated rats. 
Treatment for 2 weeks with C_D014859 caused massive focal D_D002114 of the artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal D_D002114 in 42-day-old rats. 
In contrast, no D_D061205 could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of C_D014859 treatment. 
To directly examine the importance of growth to C_D014859-induced D_D061205 in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. 
Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with C_D014859 produced massive focal D_D002114 of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable D_D061205 in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. 
Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with C_D014859 produced massive focal D_D002114 of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable D_D061205 in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. 
Although the explanation for the association between D_D061205 and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum C_D010710 and susceptibility to D_D061205, with 30% higher levels of serum C_D010710 in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to C_D014859-induced D_D061205, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats.

This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to C_D014859-induced D_D061205 could be related to higher serum C_D010710 levels.

The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between C_D014807 and C_D014859 in D_D061205. 
The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between C_D014807 and C_D014859 in D_D061205. 
High doses of C_D014807 are known to cause D_D002114 of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days. 
High doses of the C_D014812 antagonist C_D014859 are also known to cause D_D002114 of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. 
High doses of the C_D014812 antagonist C_D014859 are also known to cause D_D002114 of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. 
In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent C_D014859 administration dramatically increased the extent of D_D002114 in the media of C_D014807-treated rats at 3 and 4 days.

There was a close parallel between the effect of C_D014807 dose on D_D061205 and the effect of C_D014807 dose on the elevation of serum C_D002118, which suggests that C_D014807 may induce D_D061205 through its effect on serum C_D002118. 
There was a close parallel between the effect of C_D014807 dose on D_D061205 and the effect of C_D014807 dose on the elevation of serum C_D002118, which suggests that C_D014807 may induce D_D061205 through its effect on serum C_D002118. 
Because C_D014859 treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum C_D002118 produced by C_D014807, the synergy between C_D014859 and C_D014807 is probably best explained by the hypothesis that C_D014859 inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a D_D002114 inhibitor.

High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of D_D061205 in rats treated with C_D014807 plus C_D014859, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not C_D015055. 
High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of D_D061205 in rats treated with C_D014807 plus C_D014859, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not C_D015055.

These observations indicate that although the C_D015055 residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a D_D002114 inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at D_D002114 sites.

C_D003276 and the risk of D_D009203. 
BACKGROUND: An association between the use of C_D003276 and the risk of D_D009203 has been found in some, but not all, studies. 
We investigated this association, according to the type of C_D011372 included in third-generation (i.e., C_D017135 or C_C033273) and second-generation (i.e., C_D016912) C_D003276, the dose of C_D004967, and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based, case-control study, we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first D_D009203 between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a D_D009203 and who were matched for age, calendar year of the index event, and area of residence.

An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS: The odds ratio for D_D009203 among women who used any type of combined C_D003276, as compared with nonusers, was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.8). 
Among women who used C_D003276, the odds ratio was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.0) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 5.5) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS: The risk of D_D009203 was increased among women who used second-generation C_D003276. 
The risk of D_D009203 was similar among women who used C_D003276 whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation.

Effects of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbal shell or core on the C_D003042-induced D_D009069 in rats. 
The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens (the shell and the core) on the D_D009069 induced by C_D003042 in rats. 
C_C103477 (0.1-10 microg/side), administered intra-accumbens shell prior to C_D003042, dose-dependently attenuated the psychostimulant-induced D_D009069. 
C_C103477 (0.1-10 microg/side), administered intra-accumbens shell prior to C_D003042, dose-dependently attenuated the psychostimulant-induced D_D009069. 
Our findings indicate that C_D003042 induced D_D009069 is modified by 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell, but not core, this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (C_C103477) and agonist (C_C065046), respectively.

Epithelial C_D012964 channel (ENaC) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with C_D011692-induced D_D009404. 
Epithelial C_D012964 channel (ENaC) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with C_D011692-induced D_D009404. 
In experimental D_D009404, urinary C_D012964 excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease. 
We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in C_D011692 (C_D011692)-induced D_D009404. 
The time courses of urinary C_D012964 excretion, plasma C_D000450 concentration and D_D011507 were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either C_D011692 or vehicle. 
The time courses of urinary C_D012964 excretion, plasma C_D000450 concentration and D_D011507 were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either C_D011692 or vehicle.

The kinetics of urinary C_D012964 excretion and the appearance of D_D011507 were comparable with those reported previously. 
In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of C_D011692-induced D_D009404 in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by C_D000450 after day 3.

In the following report, a 65-year-old D_D016638 patient with a suspected history of D_D013921T was administered C_C031942 for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation. 
In the following report, a 65-year-old D_D016638 patient with a suspected history of D_D013921T was administered C_C031942 for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation. 
RESULTS: Unexpectedly high concentrations of C_C031942 were measured in these samples (range, 0-32 microg/mL), and a prolonged plasma C_C031942 half life (t(1/2)) of 514 minutes was observed (published elimination t(1/2) is 39-51 minutes [< or = 181 minutes with D_D008107]). 
CONCLUSIONS: Correlation of plasma C_C031942 concentration versus the patient's coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma C_C031942 may have contributed to the patient's extended D_D001778. 
This is the first report to measure plasma C_C031942 concentration in the context of CPB and extended D_D001778.

C_D003042-induced D_D009203: clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations. 
Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which C_D003042 may result in acute D_D009203. 
In individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute D_D009203 may result from an increase in myocardial C_D010100 demand associated with C_D003042-induced increase in rate-pressure product. 
In individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute D_D009203 may result from an increase in myocardial C_D010100 demand associated with C_D003042-induced increase in rate-pressure product. 
With regard to D_D013035, the clinical findings are largely circumstantial, and the locus of C_D003042-induced vasoconstriction remains speculative. 
Finally, the contribution of a primary, D_D013927 effect of C_D003042 has not been excluded.

Persistent D_D010243 after prolonged use of C_D001279 in the absence of corticosteroids. 
Reports of persistent D_D010243 after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid-based NMBAs such as C_D014673, especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids. 
C_D001279, a short-acting C_-1 NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function, has also been associated with persistent D_D010243, but only when used with corticosteroids. 
We report a case of C_D001279-related D_D010243 persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids.

Habitual use of C_D000082 as a risk factor for D_D007676: a comparison with C_D010615. 
Habitual use of C_D000082 as a risk factor for D_D007676: a comparison with C_D010615. 
Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of C_D010615 is associated with the development of D_D007676 and D_D007676 (D_D007676), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19. 
However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of C_D000082 is also associated with D_D007676 and D_D007676, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4. 
These studies suggest that both C_D010615 and C_D000082 may contribute to the burden of D_D007676, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. 
These studies suggest that both C_D010615 and C_D000082 may contribute to the burden of D_D007676, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. 
The possibility that habitual use of C_D000082 alone increases the risk of D_D007676 has not been clearly demonstrated, but cannot be dismissed.

C_D008094-associated D_D003072 reduced by a switch to C_D014635: a case series. 
C_D008094-associated D_D003072 reduced by a switch to C_D014635: a case series. 
BACKGROUND: C_D008094 remains a first-line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of D_D001714. 
Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of C_D008094, such as D_D011141 and D_D014202, more subtle C_D008094 side effects such as D_D003072, D_D003072, and D_D003072 remain understudied.

RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent D_D005922 (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 (n = 9), and mild-type C_D016559 D_D007674 (n = 11). 
Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674, respectively. 
Chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), D_D005923 (4 biopsies) and the striped form of D_D005355 (11 biopsies).

The serum C_D003404 levels of patients in the mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic C_D016559-D_D007674 group (P< 0.001). 
The serum C_D003404 levels of patients in the mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic C_D016559-D_D007674 group (P< 0.001). 
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.

Recurrent use of newer C_D003276 and the risk of D_D054556. 
The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of D_D054556 (D_D054556) associated with newer C_D003276 (C_D003276) did not distinguish between patterns of C_D003276 use, namely first-time users, repeaters and switchers. 
The adjusted rate ratio of D_D054556 for repeat users of third generation C_D003276 was 0.6 (95% CI:0.3-1.2) relative to repeat users of second generation pills, whereas it was 1.3 (95% CI:0.7-2.4) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills.

Development of C_D001058-induced D_D010554: comparison of adult male and female Wistar rats. 
The development of C_D001058-induced (1.0 mg/kg s.c. once daily) D_D010554 of adult male and female Wistar rats obtained from the same breeder was studied in two consecutive sets. 
In male animals, repeated C_D001058 treatment induced a gradual development of D_D010554 as evidenced by the increased intensity of D_D010554 and shortened latency before the first attack toward the opponent. 
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates gender differences in the development of the C_D001058-induced D_D010554 and indicates that the female rats do not fill the validation criteria for use in this method.

Patients aged 18 years or older treated with C_D011346 for D_D006261, D_D009325, or D_D014839 were eligible for inclusion. 
CONCLUSION: A 50% reduction in the incidence of D_D017109 when C_D011346 was administered by means of 15-minute intravenous infusion versus a 2-minute intravenous push was not detected. 
The efficacy of C_D011346 in the treatment of D_D006261 and D_D009325 likewise did not appear to be affected by the rate of administration, although no formal statistical comparisons were made.

The relationship between hippocampal C_D000109 release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal D_D012640-prone and withdrawal D_D012640-resistant selected mouse lines. 
METHODS: Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in C_D000431-na ve Withdrawal D_D012640-Prone (WSP) and-Resistant (WSR) mice. 
Animals were administered C_D009538, C_D002217, or C_D009388 via timed tail vein infusion, and the latencies to onset of D_D014202 and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose.

RESULTS: Sensitivity to several D_D012640 endpoints induced by C_D009538, C_D002217, and C_D009388 were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice. 
When hippocampal C_D000109 was measured during testing for handling-induced D_D012640, extracellular C_D000109 was significantly elevated (192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in WSR mice. 
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic D_D012640 may be associated with C_D000431 withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in C_D000431 withdrawal.

Differential modulation by C_D004967 of alpha2-adrenergic and I1-C_D048288 receptor-mediated D_D007022 in female rats. 
Differential modulation by C_D004967 of alpha2-adrenergic and I1-C_D048288 receptor-mediated D_D007022 in female rats. 
We have recently shown that C_D004967 negatively modulates the D_D007022 effect of C_D003000 (mixed alpha2-/I1-receptor agonist) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction.

Evaluation of the antiC_D003042 monoclonal antibody C_-1 as an immunotherapy for D_D062787. 
The illicit use of C_D003042 continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for D_D062787 remains elusive. 
The therapeutic potential of the antiC_D003042 antibody C_-1 was examined using a model of D_D062787. 
Significant blockade of C_D003042 D_D064420 was observed with the higher dose of C_-1 (190 mg/kg), where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40%, D_D012640 up to 77% and D_D003643 by 72%.

C_D007654 induced D_D016171 without concomitant use of QT interval-prolonging drug. 
We report a woman with D_D003324 who developed a markedly D_D008133 and D_D016171 (D_D016171) after taking C_D007654 for treatment of D_D009181.

We postulate that by virtue of its direct blocking action on IKr, C_D007654 alone may prolong QT interval and induce D_D016171. 
This calls for attention when C_D007654 is administered to patients with risk factors for acquired D_D008133.

C_D020123-associated D_D011507 and D_D007674. 
C_D020123-associated D_D011507 and D_D007674. 
C_D020123 represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft D_D007674. 
Because C_D020123 does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-D_D007674 drug'. 
However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, C_D020123 is associated with D_D011507 and acute D_D007674. 
However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, C_D020123 is associated with D_D011507 and acute D_D007674. 
The mechanisms of C_D020123-associated D_D011507 are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. 
The acute D_D007674 associated with C_D020123 (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. 
Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of C_D020123 on the kidney, the use of C_D020123 in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of D_D011507 and renal function, use of C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitors or C_D000809 II receptor blockers if D_D011507 occurs and withdrawal if needed.

Progressive D_D009135 with up-regulation of MHC-I associated with C_D019821 therapy. 
C_D019821 can cause a necrotizing D_D009135 and D_-1 which is reversible on cessation of the drug. 
What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby C_D019821s may induce a D_D009135, which persists or may progress after stopping the drug. 
These observations suggest that C_D019821s may initiate an immune-mediated D_D009135 that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy. 
The mechanism of this D_D009135 is uncertain but may involve the induction by C_D019821s of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up-regulation of MHC-I expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres.

C_D009638 signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of C_D003042-induced D_D001008. 
C_D009638 signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of C_D003042-induced D_D001008. 
While the mechanisms underlying C_D003042's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by C_D003042, such as D_D001008.

RESULTS: There were more incidents of D_D001919 in subjects treated with C_D003000 compared with those not treated with C_D003000 (17.5% versus 3.4%; p =.02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes. 
D_D006970 was common on C_D003000, but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D003000, used alone or with C_D008774, appears safe and well tolerated in childhood D_D001289.

D_D012559 has been initially associated with dysfunction in C_D004298 neurotransmission. 
However, the observation that antagonists of the C_D018698 C_D016202 (C_D016202) receptor produce D_D012559-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the C_D018698rgic system via its C_D016202 receptor.

This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of C_-1, with a particular focus on models of D_D006948, involving either drug challenge (ie, C_D000661 and C_D016291) or transgenic mice (ie, C_D016202 Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)).

Results showed that C_-1 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked D_D006948 induced by the non-competitive C_D016202 receptor antagonist, C_D016291 and partially reversed spontaneous D_D006948 of C_D016202 Nr1(neo-/-) mice.

However, unlike these latter, C_-1 did not produce D_D002375 (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, C_-1, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the C_D004298rgic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.

Reduction in injection D_D010146 using buffered C_D008012 as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization. 
Previous reports have suggested that D_D010146 associated with the injection of C_D008012 is related to the acidic pH of the solution. 
To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of C_D008012 into the physiologic range would reduce D_D010146 during injection, we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. 
Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of D_D010146 after receiving standard C_D008012 in one femoral area and buffered C_D008012 in the opposite femoral area. 
The mean D_D010146 score for buffered C_D008012 was significantly lower than the mean score for standard C_D008012 (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03). 
The pH adjustment of standard C_D008012 can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the D_D010146 occurring during the infiltration of tissues.

Tolerance and antiviral effect of C_D012254 in patients with D_D006478. 
Tolerance and antiviral effect of C_D012254 was studied in 6 patients with D_D006478 (D_D006478) of more than 8 days of evolution. 
Administration of C_D012254 resulted in a neutralization of D_D014766 and a drop of endogenous interferon titers. 
From these results, we conclude that C_D012254 has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of D_D006478, and that D_D000740, the only secondary reaction observed, can be easily managed. 
From these results, we conclude that C_D012254 has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of D_D006478, and that D_D000740, the only secondary reaction observed, can be easily managed.

C_D004176-induced D_D017202. 
D_D000787 and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral C_D004176 in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization procedures. 
To our knowledge, this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative C_D004176 therapy, although C_D004176-induced D_D017202 has been demonstrated to occur in animals and humans with D_D003324.

Noradrenergic involvement in D_D002375 induced by C_D013759. 
These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of D_D002375 induced by C_D013759, whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in D_D002375 induced by C_D006220.

Intracranial pressure increases during C_D015760-induced D_D009127. 
Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured during C_D015760-induced D_D009127 in rats. 
These variables returned to baseline when D_D009127 was abolished with C_C032943. 
These observations suggest that D_D009127 should be prevented when C_D015760, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems.

Serial studies of D_D006311 in patients receiving C_D003676 therapy. 
Visual and D_D006311 was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion-dependent D_D000740 who were receiving C_D007501 chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous C_D003676.

Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving C_D003676 doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of D_D006311, and with the exception of two cases no further D_D064420 was demonstrated. 
Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving C_D003676 doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of D_D006311, and with the exception of two cases no further D_D064420 was demonstrated. 
Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving C_D003676, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between C_D003676 administration and otoD_D064420.

The correlation between D_D020258 esterase inhibition and C_C005238-induced D_D009422 in rats. 
The correlation between D_D020258 esterase inhibition and C_C005238-induced D_D009422 in rats. 
The correlation between D_D009422 and inhibition of D_D020258 esterase or D_D009422 target enzyme (NTE) was examined in rats acutely exposed to C_C005238 (C_C005238), a D_D020258 C_D010755. 
The correlation between D_D009422 and inhibition of D_D020258 esterase or D_D009422 target enzyme (NTE) was examined in rats acutely exposed to C_C005238 (C_C005238), a D_D020258 C_D010755.

In contrast, dosages of C_C005238 (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of D_D013118 in only 9% of the animals. 
These data indicate that a critical percentage of NTE inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after C_C005238 exposure can predict D_D009422 in rats several weeks later.

D_D002544 with a single oral dose of C_D010665. 
We report the case of a young woman who suffered a D_D002544 after taking a single oral dose of C_D010665. 

passage:4812392
Treatment of D_D011565 with C_D001379. 
C_D001379 treatment benefited 19 (66%) out of 29 patients suffering from severe D_D011565. 
Liver biopsies should be undertaken at regular intervals if C_D001379 therapy is continued so that structural D_D056486 may be detected at an early and reversible stage. 

passage:6518066
Maternal C_D008094 and neonatal D_D004437: evaluation with cross-sectional echocardiography. 
Cross-sectional echocardiographic screening of newborns exposed to C_D008094 during gestation can provide highly accurate, noninvasive assessment of the presence or absence of C_D008094-induced D_D006331. 

passage:6534871
The effects of exercise on the severity of C_D007545-induced D_D009203 were studied in female albino rats of 20,40,60 and 80 weeks of age.

Effect of C_D011092 on C_D004317 D_D064420 in mice. 
Effect of C_D011092 on C_D004317 D_D064420 in mice. 
Light microscopic analysis showed a significant protection against C_D004317-induced D_D009202. 
Such treatment did not diminish the C_D004317 antitumor activity in D_D007939 and in D_D002286. 
Such treatment did not diminish the C_D004317 antitumor activity in D_D007939 and in D_D002286. 

passage:6747681
Intra-arterial C_D002330 chemotherapy for treatment of D_D005910 of the central nervous system. 
Because of the rapid systemic clearance of C_D002330 (C_D002330), intra-arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of D_D005910. 
Twenty-four patients with recurrent Grade I to IV D_D001254, whose resection and irradiation therapy had failed, received two to eight courses of intra-arterial C_D002330 therapy. 
The frequency of D_D014786 decreased after the concentration of the C_D000431 diluent was lowered. 

passage:6861444
Intrarenal infusion of C_D009638 caused D_D006973 at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously. 
These results suggest that D_D006973 after chronic intrarenal C_D009638 infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating C_D009638 and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism. 

passage:7053303
There was only one case of D_D003704 possibly due to C_D002927 (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had C_D002927 levels above 1.25 microgram/ml. 
Thus, high C_D002927 levels alone do not always induce D_D003704. 

passage:7088431
Development of D_D018262 in C_D004054-exposed offspring under observation. 
Two cases of D_D018262 of the vagina detected at follow-up in young women exposed in utero to C_D004054 are reported.

C_D017693 alleviates D_D004414 induced by intracavernous injections for D_D007172. 
In an attempt to determine whether D_D004414 associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication, we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of D_D004414 following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of C_D017693 to the intracorporeal medications. 
Of the 19 patients without C_D017693 added to the medication 11 (58%) complained of D_D004414 due to the medication, while only 1 of the 19 men (5%) who received C_D017693 complained of D_D004414.

Prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (C_D015282) on gallbladder function and D_D042882 formation in Chinese D_D000172 patients. 
Prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (C_D015282) on gallbladder function and D_D042882 formation in Chinese D_D000172 patients. 
This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active D_D000172 treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog C_D015282 in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months. 
During treatment with C_D015282, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had D_D042882s, and 1 developed D_D041881 requiring surgery. 
During treatment with C_D015282, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had D_D042882s, and 1 developed D_D041881 requiring surgery. 
After withdrawal of C_D015282 in 10 patients without D_D042882s, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. 
Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, D_D042882s, and D_D002764 during C_D015282 therapy in Chinese D_D000172 patients.

In 8 patients the diagnosis of D_D006976 was uncertain, 5 of them had taken C_D001067. 
A policy of unrestricted prescription of C_D001067 may lead to a high incidence of associated D_D006976.

Choreatiform hyperkinesias are known to be occasional D_D020820 during intoxications with C_D003042 but not opiates. 
This is a case report of euphoria and D_D002819 both transiently induced by rapid adjustment to the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist C_D008691 in an inpatient previously abusing C_D003932 and C_D003042.

D_D006461 of human erythrocytes induced by C_D013629 is related to disruption of membrane structure. 
C_D013629 (C_D013629), the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of D_D001943, induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and D_D000743. 
C_D013629 (C_D013629), the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of D_D001943, induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and D_D000743. 
This work evaluates the effects of C_D013629 on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on C_D013629-induced D_D000743 and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms. 
C_D013629 induces D_D006461 of erythrocytes as a function of concentration. 
The extension of D_D006461 is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 microM C_D013629 induces total D_D006461 of all tested suspensions. 
The D_D006461 effect of C_D013629 is prevented by low concentrations of C_D024502 (C_D024502) and C_D024502 acetate (C_D024502Ac) (inactivated functional C_D017665) indicating that C_D013629-induced D_D006461 is not related to oxidative membrane damage.

This was further evidenced by absence of C_D010100 consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with C_D013629-induced D_D006461. 
This was further evidenced by absence of C_D010100 consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with C_D013629-induced D_D006461. 
D_D006461 caused by C_D013629 was not preceded by the leakage of C_D011188(+) from the cells, also excluding a colloid-osmotic type mechanism of D_D006461, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves.

These effects suggest that the protection from D_D006461 by C_D024505 is related to a decreased C_D013629 incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided. 
These effects suggest that the protection from D_D006461 by C_D024505 is related to a decreased C_D013629 incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided. 
Therefore, C_D013629-induced D_D006461 results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane. 
These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by C_D013629, resulting in D_D000743.

Effects of long-term pretreatment with C_D007545 on C_D001971-induced D_D013610 in conscious rats. 
Effects of long-term pretreatment with C_D007545 on C_D001971-induced D_D013610 in conscious rats. 
It has been shown that C_D001971-induced D_D013610, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central C_D004298 D2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day C_D007545 pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart.

Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that C_D003000 induces sympathetic withdrawal and D_D001919, we hypothesized that C_D003000's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other. 
Age-related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and C_D003000-induced D_D001919.

C_D004177 potentiates C_D009020 antinociception but not D_D003248 after chronic treatment. 
C_D004177 potentiates C_D009020 antinociception but not D_D003248 after chronic treatment. 
This work evaluates the antinociceptive and D_D003248 effects of the combination of 3.2 mg/kg s.c. C_D009020 with 177.8 mg/kg s.c. C_D004177 in acutely and chronically treated (once a day for 12 days) rats. 
This work evaluates the antinociceptive and D_D003248 effects of the combination of 3.2 mg/kg s.c. C_D009020 with 177.8 mg/kg s.c. C_D004177 in acutely and chronically treated (once a day for 12 days) rats. 
On the 13th day, antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception, D_D010146-induced functional impairment model, and the C_D002606 meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit. 
In independent groups, C_D009020 inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4% and 38+/-4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the D_D003248 effects. 
The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by C_D009020 regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that C_D004177 did not potentiate C_D009020-induced D_D003248. 
The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by C_D009020 regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that C_D004177 did not potentiate C_D009020-induced D_D003248. 
These findings show a significant interaction between C_D009020 and C_D004177 in chronically treated rats, suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of chronic D_D010146.

C_D007069 D_D001927 presenting with D_D020820. 
We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative D_D009207 of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of C_D007069 for D_D010954. 
We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative D_D009207 of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of C_D007069 for D_D010954. 
The administration of C_D007069 was discontinued and within 12 h the D_D020820 resolved completely. 
In the patient described, the presence of D_D020820 during infusion of C_D007069, normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative D_D009207 is associated with the use of C_D007069.

We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948 in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. 
We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948 in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. 
beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of C_D009538 both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to C_D009538-induced D_D012640. 
alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to C_D009538-induced D_D012640 when compared to wild-type littermates. 
Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948. 
Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948.

D_D002543 induced by C_D014859 - the influence of drug-drug interactions. 
PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency, severity and preventability of C_D014859-induced D_D002543 due to C_D014859 and C_D014859-drug interactions in patients living in the county of Osterg tland, Sweden. 
Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether C_D014859 and C_D014859-drug interactions could have caused the D_D002543. 
RESULTS: Among 593 patients with D_D002543, 59 (10%) were assessed as related to C_D014859 treatment. 
A C_D014859-drug interaction could have contributed to the D_D006470 in 24 (41%) of the C_D014859 patients and in 7 of these (12%) the D_D006470 complication was considered being possible to avoid. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D014859-induced D_D002543 are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate. 
A significant proportion of C_D014859-related D_D002543 might have been prevented if greater caution had been taken when prescribing drugs known to interact with C_D014859.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind comparison of C_D007479 and C_C044834 in patients with D_D051436 (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 20 to 59 mL/min) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions. 
In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of D_D003920, use of C_D000111, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups. 
In patients with D_D003920, SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL were 5.1% (4 of 78 patients) with C_D007479 and 13.0% (12 of 92 patients) with C_C044834 (P=0.11), whereas SCr increases > or = 25% were 10.3% and 15.2%, respectively (P=0.37).

Because the D_D009422 caused by C_D008694 and C_D015632 is highly selective for the C_D004298 neuronal system in mouse models of D_D020258, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in C_D008694-induced D_D020258 and microglial activation.

Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with C_D008694 and examined for striatal D_D020258. 
We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate C_D008694 D_D020258 or microglial activation.

BACKGROUND: C_D010208 is a direct-acting vasodilator used to manage D_D020301 during various neurosurgical operations. 
Transient D_D003389 has been described in a few cases with topical C_D010208. 
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical C_D010208 for D_D020301. 
Topical C_D010208 was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage D_D020301 in a total of 11 patients. 
CONCLUSIONS: Topical C_D010208 for the treatment of D_D020301 was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway. 
Recommendations to avoid potential D_D003389 from C_D010208 are provided.

Clinically significant D_D011507 following the administration of C_D020123 to renal transplant recipients. 
BACKGROUND: C_D020123 is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less D_D007674 than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens. 
To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant D_D011507 linked with the use of C_D020123. 
We have encountered several patients who developed substantial D_D011507 associated with C_D020123 use. 
In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of C_D020123 therapy and D_D011507 implicated C_D020123 as the most likely etiology of the D_D011507. 
In these patients, the magnitude of D_D011507 was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:C_D003404 ratios, an estimate of grams of D_D011507/day. 
In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of C_D020123 and the development of D_D009404-range D_D011507. 
In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of C_D020123 and the development of D_D009404-range D_D011507. 
D_D011507 correlated most strongly with C_D020123 therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. 
In most patients, discontinuation of C_D020123 resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of D_D011507. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D020123 induces or aggravates pre-existing D_D011507 in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. 
D_D011507 may improve, but does not resolve, when C_D020123 is withdrawn.

This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate-release C_D010098 in healthy, older (> 65 years), and middle-aged (35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily D_D010146. 
This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic D_D010146, neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate-release C_D010098 are similar to those observed for middle-aged adults.

Role of C_D019820 oxidase in C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in rats. 
Role of C_D019820 oxidase in C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in rats. 
Glucocorticoid-induced D_D006973 (GC-D_D006973) in the rat is associated with C_D009569-redox imbalance. 
We studied the role of C_D019820 oxidase (XO), which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species, in C_D003907-induced D_D006973 (C_D003907-D_D006973).

C_D003907 D_D006973 (110 +/- 2-126 +/- 3 mmHg; P < 0.001) and D_D015431 (P" < 0.01). 
C_D003907 D_D006973 (110 +/- 2-126 +/- 3 mmHg; P < 0.001) and D_D015431 (P" < 0.01). 
C_D000493 did not prevent C_D003907-D_D006973. 
C_D000493 did not prevent C_D003907-D_D006973. 
This, together with our previous findings that C_D000493 failed to prevent adrenocorticotrophic hormone induced D_D006973, suggests that XO activity is not a major determinant of GC-D_D006973 in the rat.

C_D012642-induced D_D007024 in D_D010300: a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal. 
OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom D_D010300 Research Group (UKD_D010300RG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with D_D010300 (D_D010300) randomized to receive 10 mg C_D012642 per day and C_D007980 compared with those taking C_D007980 alone. 
OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom D_D010300 Research Group (UKD_D010300RG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with D_D010300 (D_D010300) randomized to receive 10 mg C_D012642 per day and C_D007980 compared with those taking C_D007980 alone. 
Recently, we found that therapy with C_D012642 and C_D007980 was associated with selective D_D007024 which was abolished by withdrawal of C_D012642. 
Recently, we found that therapy with C_D012642 and C_D007980 was associated with selective D_D007024 which was abolished by withdrawal of C_D012642. 
The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping C_D012642 in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes D_D007024. 
METHODS: The cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in D_D010300 patients receiving C_D012642 and as the drug was withdrawn. 
RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused D_D007024 which was marked in six of 20 D_D010300 patients on C_D012642, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. 
RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused D_D007024 which was marked in six of 20 D_D010300 patients on C_D012642, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. 
D_D007024 was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of C_D012642 and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. 
Stopping C_D012642 also significantly D_D007024 consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action. 
CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that C_D012642 in combination with C_D007980 is associated with selective D_D007024.

Pseudo-D_D004342 to C_D000305: diagnosis and alternatives. 
These results suggest that C_D010248 caused pseudoD_D004342 in our patients. 
Corticosteroids different from C_D010248 also produced D_D004342 reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. 
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudo-D_D004342 caused by C_D010248.

D_D006463 after treatment with C_D008795. 
This paper describes the clinical features of six children who developed the D_D006463 after treatment with C_D008795. 
While the involvement of C_D008795 in the aetiology of the D_D006463 is not established firmly, the action of this drug in sensitizing tissues to oxidation injury and the reported evidence of oxidation changes in the D_D006463 suggest a possible link between C_D008795 treatment and some cases of the D_D006463.

Reversible D_D001927 in C_D008795-induced D_D001927: magnetic resonance findings on diffusion-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging. 
OBJECTIVE: This is to present reversible D_D001927s in C_D008795-induced D_D001927, to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having C_D008795-induced D_D001927 (age range; 43-78 years). 
They had been taking C_D008795 (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the D_D007239 in various organs. 
CONCLUSIONS: Reversible D_D001927s could be considered as the characteristic for C_D008795-induced D_D001927, next to the dentate nucleus involvement.

The incidence of postoperative respiratory D_D001049 was compared between five patients receiving a continuous i.v. infusion of C_D009020 (mean 73.6 mg) and five patients receiving a continuous extradural infusion of 0.25% C_D002045 (mean 192 mg) in the 24-h period following upper abdominal surgery. 
The incidence of postoperative respiratory D_D001049 was compared between five patients receiving a continuous i.v. infusion of C_D009020 (mean 73.6 mg) and five patients receiving a continuous extradural infusion of 0.25% C_D002045 (mean 192 mg) in the 24-h period following upper abdominal surgery. 
Both obstructive (P less than 0.05) and central D_D001049 (P less than 0.05) occurred more frequently in patients who had a C_D009020 infusion. 
There was also a higher incidence of D_D013610 (P less than 0.05) and D_D018879 (P less than 0.05) in the C_D009020 infusion group.

Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in D_D004827 patients after C_D010672 D_D062787. 
Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in D_D004827 patients after C_D010672 D_D062787. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between C_D010672 medication and D_D002526 in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication. 
Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between D_D012640 duration, elevation of C_D010672 serum levels and cerebellar volume. 
We conclude that C_D010672 D_D062787 does not necessarily result in D_D002526 and it is unlikely that C_D010672 medication was the only cause of D_D002526 in the remaining patients.

Evaluation of cardiac troponin I and T levels as markers of D_D009202 in C_D004317-induced D_D009202 rats, and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings. 
We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of D_D009202 in a rat model of C_D004317 (C_D004317)-induced D_D009202, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of D_D006331 monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. 
We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of D_D009202 in a rat model of C_D004317 (C_D004317)-induced D_D009202, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of D_D006331 monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. 
RESULTS: Eighteen of the C_D004317 rats died prematurely of general D_D064420 during the 9-week period. 
Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given C_D004317 revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial D_D005355. 
CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of D_D017202 after C_D004317 in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect D_D009202 assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. 
CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of D_D017202 after C_D004317 in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect D_D009202 assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. 
Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after C_D004317, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after C_D004317 indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardioD_D064420 and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.

D_D004827 following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing C_D014148 in rats. 
However, C_D014148 has been shown to cause D_D004827. 
We wanted to study whether C_D014148 retains its D_D012640 action if incorporated into a FS. 
FINDINGS: FS containing C_D014148 caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct D_D012640 behaviours. 
The degree of these D_D012640 increased with increasing concentration of C_D014148. 
Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml C_D014148 evoked generalized D_D012640 in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of C_D014148 (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated D_D012640 potentials in 1 of 6 rats. 
INTERPRETATION: C_D014148 retains its D_D012640 action within FS.

Brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of C_D018943-induced D_D066126. 
C_D018943 are effective antineoplastic drugs, but they frequently cause dose-related D_D066126. 
The D_D066126 of conventional C_D018943 therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting D_D006331. 
The D_D066126 of conventional C_D018943 therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting D_D006331. 
We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of C_D018943-induced D_D066126 in patients with D_D015470 treated with a C_D003630 (C_D003630)-containing regimen.

Thirteen patients with D_D015470 were treated with a C_D003630-containing regimen. 
On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without D_D006333 given C_D003630, even at more than 700 mg/m(2). 
These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of C_D018943-induced D_D066126.

Combined effects of prolonged C_D000527 (C_D000527)-induced D_D007022 and D_D020141 on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery. 
D_D020141 in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of C_D003911 solution, and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22%. 
Controlled D_D007022 in groups A and C was induced with C_D000527 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min. 
In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min (-40%) and at 180 min (-49%) after the start of D_D007022 and at 60 min (-32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total C_D001663 showed significant increases after operation.

C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in patients with D_D010300: filling the bench-to-bedside gap. 
C_D007980 is the most effective drug for the treatment of D_D010300. 
However, the long-term use of this C_D004298 precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and D_D004409. 
Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying C_D007980-induced D_D004409, their pathogenesis is still unclear. 
Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms, C_D004298 receptor subtypes, ionotropic and metabotropic C_D018698 receptors, and non-C_D004298rgic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of C_D007980-induced D_D004409.

BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors C_D016572 and C_D016559 are both known to be D_D007674. 
BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors C_D016572 and C_D016559 are both known to be D_D007674. 
Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no D_D007676 or D_D007676, n=748; D_D007676, sustained serum C_D003404 >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and D_D007676, n=45. 
Compared with control patients, D_D007676 and D_D007676 patients had higher preoperative serum C_D003404 levels, a greater percentage of patients with D_D006530, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum C_D003404. 
Compared with control patients, D_D007676 and D_D007676 patients had higher preoperative serum C_D003404 levels, a greater percentage of patients with D_D006530, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum C_D003404. 
Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum C_D003404 compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of D_D007676 or D_D007676 with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. 
Patients who develop D_D007676 have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum C_D003404 and are more likely to have D_D006530. 
Patients who develop D_D007676 have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum C_D003404 and are more likely to have D_D006530. 
However, an increase of serum C_D003404 at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of D_D007676 or D_D007676.

Effect of intravenous C_D009553 on blood pressure and outcome after D_D020521. 
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous C_D009553 West European D_D020521 Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between C_D009553-induced D_D007022 (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in D_D020521. 
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous C_D009553 West European D_D020521 Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between C_D009553-induced D_D007022 (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in D_D020521. 
METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of D_D002544 (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) C_D009553 (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) C_D009553 (n=94). 
C_D009553 treatment resulted in a statistically significant D_D007022 (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. 
CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose C_D009553 after D_D020521.

The role of C_D009538 in smoking-related D_D002318. 
C_D009538 activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to D_D002318. 
Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that C_D009538 could play a role in accelerating D_D050197, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect. 
C_D009538 does not appear to enhance D_D013927 among humans.

C_D015282, an effective treatment for D_D000172, induces D_D042882 in 13-60% of patients. 
Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 C_D015282 treated D_D000172 patients with D_D042882. 
Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 C_D015282 treated D_D000172 patients with D_D042882. 
Chemical analysis of D_D042882 retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients, showed that they contained 71% and 87% C_D002784 by weight. 
After one year of treatment, five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial (n = 3) or complete (n = 2) D_D042882 dissolution, suggesting that their stones were C_D002784 rich. 
In conclusion, C_D015282 induced D_D042882 are generally small, multiple, and C_D002784 rich although, in common with spontaneous D_D042882 disease, at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some D_D042882 containing C_D002118.

Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger C_D012313 levels, prolactin signaling, and D_D006966 inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on C_D004958. 
Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger C_D012313 levels, prolactin signaling, and D_D006966 inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on C_D004958. 
We first tested whether chronic D_D006966 inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the C_D004967-induced LH surge. 
Chronic D_D006966 induced by the C_D004298 antagonist C_D013469 caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of C_D004958.

OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of D_D001749, and its relation to C_D003520, in patients with D_D014890. 
Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between C_D003520 and D_D001749 using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. 
The risk of D_D001749 doubled for every 10 g increment in C_D003520 (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). 
CONCLUSION: The results indicate a dose-response relationship between C_D003520 and the risk of D_D001749, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before D_D014890.

The effect of C_C020972 on D_D013226-associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated C_D010862 model. 
Treatment with 150 mg/kg C_C020972 before and following D_D013226 significantly increased the mortality rate to 100%. 
Administration of 50 mg/kg C_C020972 (low-dose) did not exert major effects on the development of a D_D013226 or the mortality rate. 
A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle- and C_C020972-treated rats following D_D013226. 
In conclusion, the NF-kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant C_C020972 protected the piriform cortex, whereas it did not affect hilar D_D009410. 
These data might indicate that the generation of reactive C_D010100 species and activation of NF-kappaB plays a more central role in D_D012640-associated D_D009410 in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus.

Monkeys with acute (short-term) C_D015632 exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of C_D007980 therapy developed D_D004409 between 11 and 24 days of daily C_D007980 administration. 
Monkeys with acute (short-term) C_D015632 exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of C_D007980 therapy developed D_D004409 between 11 and 24 days of daily C_D007980 administration. 
In contrast, monkeys with long-term C_D015632 exposure, slow symptom progression and/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of C_D007980 therapy were more resistant to developing D_D004409 (e.g., D_D004409 developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic C_D007980 administration). 
In contrast, monkeys with long-term C_D015632 exposure, slow symptom progression and/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of C_D007980 therapy were more resistant to developing D_D004409 (e.g., D_D004409 developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic C_D007980 administration). 
These data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop D_D004409 in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to C_D007980 and demonstrate the value of these models for further studying the pathophysiology of D_D004409.

PURPOSE: We reviewed the results of serum C_D013739 and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of D_D007172 and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities. 
Every patient was screened for C_D013739 and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of D_D020018, D_D006177 or C_D013739 less than 4 ng. 
Every patient was screened for C_D013739 and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of D_D020018, D_D006177 or C_D013739 less than 4 ng. 
Endocrine therapy consisted of C_D013739 heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for D_D007006 and C_D001971 for D_D006966.

Endocrine therapy consisted of C_D013739 heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for D_D007006 and C_D001971 for D_D006966. 
Two D_D010911 were discovered after C_D013739 determination. 
Most of the other low C_D013739 levels seemed to result from nonorganic D_D007027 because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in D_D007172 (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%).

Determining C_D013739 only in cases of D_D020018 or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low C_D013739, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. 
CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low C_D013739 and high prolactin in D_D007172 cannot justify their routine determination. 
We now advocate that before age 50 years C_D013739 be determined only in cases of D_D020018 and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years. 
Prolactin should be determined only in cases of D_D020018, D_D006177 and/or C_D013739 less than 4 ng. 
Prolactin should be determined only in cases of D_D020018, D_D006177 and/or C_D013739 less than 4 ng.
