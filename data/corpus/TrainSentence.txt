RESULTS: 272 cases of D_D003221 were reported with C_D014635: 153 women and 119 men.		C_D014635		D_D003221		8		4		4		14		1		723		0		1		1

In the following report, a 65-year-old D_D016638 patient with a suspected history of D_D013921T was administered C_C031942 for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation.		C_C031942		D_D013921		16		13		3		24		1		1633		1		1		0
RESULTS: Unexpectedly high concentrations of C_C031942 were measured in these samples (range, 0-32 microg/mL), and a prolonged plasma C_C031942 half life (t(1/2)) of 514 minutes was observed (published elimination t(1/2) is 39-51 minutes [< or = 181 minutes with D_D008107]).

C_D001279, a short-acting C_-1 NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function, has also been associated with persistent D_D010243, but only when used with corticosteroids.		C_D001279		D_D010243		0		20		20		27		0		953		1		1		1

Habitual use of C_D000082 as a risk factor for D_D007676: a comparison with C_D010615.		C_D010615		D_D007676		13		9		4		14		1		571		0		0		1
Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of C_D010615 is associated with the development of D_D007676 and D_D007676 (D_D007676), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19.		C_D010615		D_D007676		14		24		10		36		0		1050		0		1		1
However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of C_D000082 is also associated with D_D007676 and D_D007676, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4.		C_D000082		D_D007676		21		28		7		40		0		1304		1		1		0
These studies suggest that both C_D010615 and C_D000082 may contribute to the burden of D_D007676, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former.		C_D000082		D_D007676		7		14		7		29		0		401		1		1		0

Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of C_D020123 on the kidney, the use of C_D020123 in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of D_D011507 and renal function, use of C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitors or C_D000809 II receptor blockers if D_D011507 occurs and withdrawal if needed.

However, unlike these latter, C_-1 did not produce D_D002375 (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, C_-1, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the C_D004298rgic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.

Reduction in injection D_D010146 using buffered C_D008012 as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization.		C_D008012		D_D010146		6		3		3		14		1		224		0		0		1
Previous reports have suggested that D_D010146 associated with the injection of C_D008012 is related to the acidic pH of the solution.		C_D008012		D_D010146		11		5		6		21		1		873		0		1		1
To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of C_D008012 into the physiologic range would reduce D_D010146 during injection, we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.		C_D008012		D_D010146		14		21		7		35		0		808		0		1		1

The mean D_D010146 score for buffered C_D008012 was significantly lower than the mean score for standard C_D008012 (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03).		C_D008012		D_D010146		16		2		14		27		1		514		0		1		1

In contrast, dosages of C_C005238 (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of D_D013118 in only 9% of the animals.		C_C005238		D_D013118		4		38		34		45		0		725		0		1		1

Because of the rapid systemic clearance of C_D002330 (C_D002330), intra-arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of D_D005910.		C_D002330		D_D005910		8		23		15		24		0		1935		0		1		0

CONCLUSION: In patients with risk factors, e.g. regular consumption of C_D000431, D_D017093 is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested.		C_D000431		D_D017093		10		11		1		19		0		748		0		1		0

Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between D_D012640 duration, elevation of C_D010672 serum levels and cerebellar volume.		C_D010672		D_D012640		14		10		4		20		1		380		0		1		0

Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after C_D004317, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after C_D004317 indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardioD_D064420 and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.

Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum C_D003404 compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of D_D007676 or D_D007676 with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively.

METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of D_D002544 (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) C_D009553 (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) C_D009553 (n=94).		C_D009553		D_D002544		27		7		20		29		1		0		0		1		0

PURPOSE: We reviewed the results of serum C_D013739 and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of D_D007172 and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities.

Most of the other low C_D013739 levels seemed to result from nonorganic D_D007027 because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in D_D007172 (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%).

Determining C_D013739 only in cases of D_D020018 or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low C_D013739, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy.		C_D013739		D_D020018		20		6		14		30		1		1109		0		1		1

We now advocate that before age 50 years C_D013739 be determined only in cases of D_D020018 and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years.		C_D013739		D_D020018		8		15		7		32		0		857		0		1		1

C_D013988-induced D_D000741: report of three Chinese patients and review of the literature.		C_D013988		D_D000741		0		1		1		12		0		1671		0		0		1
In this study, three Chinese patients with C_D013988-induced D_D000741 were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed.		C_D013988		D_D000741		7		8		1		21		0		2310		0		1		1
D_D000380 occurred 3-20 weeks after initiation of C_D013988, so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended.		C_D013988		D_D000380		7		0		7		19		1		540		0		1		1
Treatment for C_D013988-induced D_D000741 with colony-stimulating factors seemed to have little effect.		C_D013988		D_D000741		2		3		1		12		0		780		0		1		1

D_D000647 produced by C_D012601 and C_D003513 were reversed by C_D009020 given 30 min before the test trial (pre-test), and pre-test C_D009020 also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered C_D009270 during the training trial.		C_D003513		D_D000647		5		0		5		35		1		169		0		1		1

C_D001058, a nonselective C_D018491, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce D_D007035, and to produce distinct changes to C_D004298 turnover in the rodent brain.		C_D018491		D_D007035		3		16		13		29		0		1228		0		1		0
