METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg, a known D_D012640 dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of C_D016642-induced D_D012640 in the Swiss albino mice.		C_D016642		D_D012640		28		29		1		35		0		1160		0		1		1
RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced D_D012640 in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1.		C_D016642		D_D012640		8		16		8		30		0		1352		0		1		1
Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of D_D012640 at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection.

There is a statistically significant reduction of D_D001943 among women receiving C_D013629 who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of D_D001943 compared with one case among 362 women allocated to C_D013629.

C_D004298 (C_D004298), through D1/D2 receptor-mediated signaling, plays a major role in the control of D_D004827 arising in the limbic system.		C_D004298		D_D004827		1		14		13		20		0		0		0		1		0

A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when C_D000661 was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the D_D009069.		C_D000661		D_D009069		10		28		18		29		0		567		1		1		1
However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, C_D000661 dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), C_D000661-induced D_D009069 tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further C_D000661 injections.

C_D017239 (C_D017239; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different D_D009369 types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma.		C_D017239		D_D009369		1		14		13		21		0		1052		0		1		0
Two phase II trials of 24-hour C_D017239 infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV D_D002289 (D_D002289) reported response rates of 21% and 24%.		C_D017239		D_D002289		6		17		11		25		0		1677		0		1		0
We investigated the efficacy and D_D064420 of a 3-hour C_D017239 infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV D_D002289.		C_D017239		D_D064420		9		5		4		25		1		863		0		1		0
We investigated the efficacy and D_D064420 of a 3-hour C_D017239 infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV D_D002289.		C_D017239		D_D002289		9		24		15		25		0		863		0		1		0
C_D017239 is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic D_D064420.		C_D017239		D_D064420		0		33		33		34		0		1024		0		1		0

In order to determine if C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D020521 in normotensive and/or D_D006973 rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days.

The current data showed that C_D010862 significantly delayed onset of D_D001145s, decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, reduced D_D001145 score, and increased the survival time of D_D001145 rats and guinea pigs.		C_D010862		D_D001145		5		29		24		34		0		1179		0		1		0

In contrast, the highest dose of C_D008550 (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of D_D053608, and a reduction in mortality rate.		C_D008550		D_D053608		6		25		19		32		0		1832		0		1		1

BACKGROUND: D_D013617-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of D_D001281 (D_D001281) and decreases L-type C_D002118(2+) current.		C_D002118		D_D013617		14		1		13		16		1		731		0		1		0

There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type C_D002118(2) channel blockade can promote D_D001281, consistent with an D_D001281 promoting effect of C_D002118(2+) channel inhibition.		C_D002118		D_D001281		22		18		4		25		1		638		0		1		0
METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of D_D001281 promotion by C_D002118(2+) channel blockers, we administered C_D014700 to C_D009020-C_D002698 anesthetized dogs.		C_D014700		D_D001281		15		7		8		20		1		0		0		1		1

RESULTS: C_D014700 caused D_D001281 promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of D_D001281 induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg.

In these experiments, C_D014700 shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of D_D001281 (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005).

C_D004110 did not affect ERP, D_D001281 cycle length or D_D001281 duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by C_D014700 (n=5).		C_D004110		D_D001281		0		9		9		22		0		1156		0		1		0

In the presence of autonomic blockade, C_D014700 failed to promote D_D001281 and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness.		C_D014700		D_D001281		6		10		4		17		0		1223		0		1		1
Epicardial mapping suggested that C_D014700 promoted D_D001281 by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle.		C_D014700		D_D001281		4		6		2		23		0		729		0		1		1

BACKGROUND: The most striking of C_D016190's advantages (C_D016190) over C_D002945 (C_D002945) is its markedly reduced rate of D_D020258 effects.		C_D016190		D_D020258		7		17		10		19		0		765		0		1		1

CONCLUSIONS: C_D016190 is D_D020258 in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by C_D002945 that it is probable that D_D020258ity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.		C_D016190		D_D020258		1		29		28		40		0		1419		0		1		1

A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine the effect-site concentration (Ce) of C_C071741 to prevent the D_D010146 without producing complications.		C_C071741		D_D010146		15		19		4		23		0		989		0		1		0
C_C071741-related complications were assessed during the C_C071741 infusion, and D_D010146 caused by C_D015742 was evaluated using a four-point scale during the C_D015742 infusion.		C_D015742		D_D010146		21		9		12		23		1		1182		0		1		1

Prenatal exposure to C_D005473 induces fetal D_D006976 in the rat.		C_D005473		D_D006976		3		6		3		10		0		775		0		0		1
Epidemiological data suggest that C_D005473 exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent D_D006976 of the newborn.		C_D005473		D_D006976		4		12		8		16		0		577		0		1		1
The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a D_D006976 protective C_D005473 effect in adult rodents.		C_D005473		D_D006976		18		16		2		23		1		770		0		1		1
As compared with controls, C_D005473 exposure resulted in fetal D_D006976 as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01).

CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the adult, C_D005473 exposure in utero induces D_D006976 in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation.		C_D005473		D_D006976		6		11		5		30		0		2734		0		1		1

RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included C_D006493 exposure--in most cases, with no D_D013921 recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with D_D013923 complications.		C_D006493		D_D013923		9		26		17		28		0		585		0		1		1

To avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider C_D006493-induced D_D013921 whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with D_D013923; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not C_D006493, should be initiated.		C_D006493		D_D013923		22		16		6		26		1		1435		0		1		1
