the	present	study	demonstrate	that	growth	and	c_d014807	treatment	enhance	the	extent	of	d_d061205	in	rat	give	sufficient	dose	of	c_d014859	to	inhibit	gamma-carboxylation	of	matrix	gla	protein	,	a	d_d002114	inhibitor	know	to	be	express	by	smooth	muscle	cell	and	macrophage	in	the	artery	wall	.	
the	first	series	of	experiment	examine	the	influence	of	age	and	growth	status	on	d_d061205	in	c_d014859-treated	rat	.	
in	contrast	,	no	d_d061205	could	be	detect	in	10-month-old	adult	rat	even	after	4	week	of	c_d014859	treatment	.	
to	directly	examine	the	importance	of	growth	to	c_d014859-induced	d_d061205	in	animal	of	the	same	age	,	20-day-old	rat	be	feed	for	2	week	either	a	ad	libitum	diet	or	a	6-g/d	restricted	diet	that	maintain	weight	but	prevent	growth	.

although	the	explanation	for	the	association	between	d_d061205	and	growth	status	can	not	be	determine	from	the	present	study	,	there	be	a	relationship	between	higher	serum	c_d010710	and	susceptibility	to	d_d061205	,	with	30	%	higher	level	of	serum	c_d010710	in	young	,	ad	libitum-fed	rat	compare	with	either	of	the	group	that	be	resistant	to	c_d014859-induced	d_d061205	,	ie	,	the	10-month-old	rat	and	the	restricted-diet	,	growth-inhibit	young	rat	.	
this	observation	suggest	that	increase	susceptibility	to	c_d014859-induced	d_d061205	could	be	relate	to	higher	serum	c_d010710	level	.	
the	second	set	of	experiment	examine	the	possible	synergy	between	c_d014807	and	c_d014859	in	d_d061205	.

the	low	incidence	of	d_d002543	as	a	cause	of	d_d003643	in	patient	with	d_d010300	may	reflect	the	d_d007022	effect	of	c_d007980	and	a	d_d007022	mechanism	due	to	reduce	c_d009638	level	in	the	d_d010300	brain	.	
from	these	result	,	we	conclude	that	c_d012254	have	a	antiviral	effect	in	advanced	case	of	d_d006478	,	and	that	d_d000740	,	the	only	secondary	reaction	observe	,	can	be	easily	manage	.

in	order	to	clarify	the	nature	of	this	initial	d_d009069	we	examine	the	effect	of	the	duration	of	recovery	period	after	the	lesion	,	on	c_d000661-induced	d_d009069	.	
a	substantial	degree	of	contralateral	preference	be	still	evident	when	c_d000661	be	administer	for	the	first	time	24	day	after	lesion	,	indicate	involvement	of	spare	cell	in	the	d_d009069	.	
however	,	regardless	of	the	duration	of	recovery	-lrb-	and	irrespective	of	either	lesion	volume	,	c_d000661	dose	,	or	post-lesion	motor	exercise	-rrb-	,	c_d000661-induced	d_d009069	tend	to	become	gradually	more	ipsilateral	as	the	observation	session	progress	,	and	all	rat	circle	ipsilaterally	to	the	lesion	in	response	to	further	c_d000661	injection	.	
these	finding	suggest	that	c_d000661	have	a	irreversible	effect	on	the	post-lesion	DA	pool	contribute	to	d_d009069	.	
it	have	be	suggest	that	adenylate	cyclase	inhibition	may	be	important	in	the	development	of	both	d_d018500	and	d_d007037	during	c_d008094	treatment	.

the	number	of	bfu-e	and	the	percentage	of	bone	marrow	erythroblast	observe	be	comparable	in	c_d015215	and	c_c030299	treated	mouse	with	similar	degree	of	d_d000740	.	
however	,	d_d045262	be	inappropriate	for	the	degree	of	d_d000740	observe	in	c_d015215	treat	infected	mouse	.	
c_d015215-induced	peripheral	d_d000740	in	the	face	of	increase	number	of	bfu-e	and	increase	level	of	plasma	epo	suggest	a	lesion	in	terminal	differentiation	.

result	:	c_d014700	cause	d_d001281	promotion	in	six	dog	,	increase	mean	duration	of	d_d001281	induce	by	burst	pacing	,	from	8	+	/	-4	s	-lrb-	mean	+	/	-	s.e.	-rrb-	to	95	+	/	-39	s	-lrb-	p	<	0.01	vs.	control	-rrb-	at	a	load	dose	of	0.1	mg/kg	and	228	+	/	-101	s	-lrb-	p	<	0.0005	vs.	control	-rrb-	at	a	dose	of	0.2	mg/kg	.	
in	these	experiment	,	c_d014700	shorten	mean	effective	refractory	period	-lrb-	erp	-rrb-	from	122	+	/	-5	to	114	+	/	-4	m	-lrb-	p	<	0.02	-rrb-	at	a	cycle	length	of	300	m	,	decrease	erp	heterogeneity	-lrb-	from	15	+	/	-1	to	10	+	/	-1	%	,	p	<	0.05	-rrb-	,	heterogeneously	accelerate	atrial	conduction	and	decrease	the	cycle	length	of	d_d001281	-lrb-	94	+	/	-4	to	84	+	/	-3	m	,	p	<	0.005	-rrb-	.	
c_d004110	do	not	affect	erp	,	d_d001281	cycle	length	or	d_d001281	duration	,	but	produce	conduction	acceleration	similar	to	that	cause	by	c_d014700	-lrb-	n	=	5	-rrb-	.	
in	the	presence	of	autonomic	blockade	,	c_d014700	fail	to	promote	d_d001281	and	increase	,	rather	than	decrease	,	refractoriness	.	
epicardial	mapping	suggest	that	c_d014700	promote	d_d001281	by	increase	the	number	of	simultaneous	wavefront	reflect	by	separate	zone	of	reactivation	in	each	cycle	.	
conclusion	:	c_d014700	promote	d_d001281	in	normal	dog	by	promote	multiple	circuit	reentry	,	a	effect	dependent	on	intact	autonomic	tone	and	not	share	by	c_d004110	.
