The D_D007022 effect of 100 mg/kg C_D008750 was also partially reversed by C_D009270. 
C_D008012-induced D_D006323. 
C_D013390 infusion rate and observed D_D005207. 
C_D005702, an anticholinesterase drug capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier, was used in a patient demonstrating central effects of C_D012601 (C_D012601) D_D062787. 
Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on C_D008094-induced D_D007676 in rats. 
C_D008094thium also caused D_D011507 and systolic D_D006973 in absence of D_D005921. 
C_D008094thium also caused D_D011507 and systolic D_D006973 in absence of D_D005921. 
The results indicate that C_D008094-induced D_D007674, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with D_D011507 and arterial systolic D_D006973.

Eleven of the C_D003042 abusers and none of the controls had ECG evidence of significant D_D009202 defined as D_D009203, D_D007511, and D_D002037. 
Eleven of the C_D003042 abusers and none of the controls had ECG evidence of significant D_D009202 defined as D_D009203, D_D007511, and D_D002037. 
C_D013469-induced D_D004421. 
We studied a 37-year-old man who developed persistent segmental D_D004421 within 2 months after starting C_D013469 therapy. 
We could not find any previous reports of C_D013469-induced D_D004421. 
During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving C_D003676 (10-40 mg/kg BW/3 times weekly) for the first time were monitored for detection of D_D014786|D006311. 
The data indicate that D_D014786|D006311 is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving C_D003676. 
D_D009157 presenting as weakness after C_D008274 administration. 
Although D_D010243 after C_D008274 administration has been described in patients with known D_D009157, it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease. 
Twenty common D_D008881 patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of C_D005996 (10 patients) or placebo ointment (10 patients) in a double blind study. 
Early onset D_D008881 attacks were induced by C_D005996 in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group. 
Subsequently 20 D_D008881 patients, who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal C_D005996, received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas. 
Thus the D_D008881-inducing effect of C_D005996 seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of D_D010146, suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a D_D008881 crisis. 
C_C084599-induced acute D_D056486. 
We report the case of a patient who developed acute D_D056486 with D_D047508, 7 months after the onset of administration of C_C084599, a C_C013295 derivative. 
The administration of several C_D001569, chemically related to C_C084599, did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of D_D056486. 
This observation shows that C_C084599 can induce acute D_D056486 and suggests that there is no cross D_D056486 between C_C084599 and several C_D001569. 
Arterial D_D006973 as a complication of prolonged C_D007654 treatment. 
Two of 14 patients with D_D003480 treated on a long-term basis with C_D007654 developed sustained D_D006973. 
In both cases normal plasma and urinary free C_D006854 levels had been achieved following C_D007654 therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated D_D006973 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment. 
Our findings show that long-term treatment with high doses of C_D007654 may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid-related D_D006973. 
Induction of D_D004211 and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and C_D014148 (C_D014148) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after D_D014947 or D_D018805 in man. 
A randomized comparison of C_D007741 and C_D009599 for induced D_D007022. 
A randomized comparison of C_D007741 and C_D009599 for induced D_D007022. 
In a randomized study, C_D007741-induced D_D007022 and C_D009599-induced D_D007022 were compared in 20 patients (10 in each group) scheduled for major orthopedic procedures. 
In a randomized study, C_D007741-induced D_D007022 and C_D009599-induced D_D007022 were compared in 20 patients (10 in each group) scheduled for major orthopedic procedures. 
Nitroprusside infusion was associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) D_D016534; rebound D_D006973 was observed in three patients after discontinuation of C_D009599. 
D_D012640 induced by C_D005481 (C_D005481) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by C_D002220 than D_D012640 induced by maximal electroshock (MES). 
Oral administration of C_D002220 as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against C_D005481-induced D_D012640 and was minimally toxic as measured by D_D015430 over 8 weeks of treatment. 
Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no D_D013610 and no augmentation of the C_D009638 release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable D_D007022 induced by C_D006830 or C_D005996. 
Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no D_D013610 and no augmentation of the C_D009638 release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable D_D007022 induced by C_D006830 or C_D005996. 
D_D007172 was more common among male patients than controls and was found to be associated with co-morbidity and the taking of C_D008727. 
Does C_D000082 cause D_D014523 or D_D007681? 
The risk of developing D_D007681 or cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter or bladder associated with consumption of either C_D010615 or C_D000082 was calculated from data acquired by questionnaire from 381 cases and 808 controls. 
The risk of developing D_D007681 or cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter or bladder associated with consumption of either C_D010615 or C_D000082 was calculated from data acquired by questionnaire from 381 cases and 808 controls. 
The risk of D_D007681 was increased nearly 20-fold by consumption of C_D010615, which also increased the risk for cancer of the renal pelvis and bladder but not for D_D014516. 
By contrast, we were unable to substantiate an increased risk from C_D000082 consumption for D_D007681 or any of these D_D009369 although there was a suggestion of an association with D_D014516. 
C_D003622-associated Heinz body D_D000743 in a Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait. 
A Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait (AE) and D_D007918 developed a Heinz body D_D000743 while taking a dose of C_D003622 (50 mg/day) not usually associated with clinical D_D006461. 
Thus, AE RBCs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo, since C_D003622 does not cause D_D000743 at this dose in hematologically normal individuals. 
C_D014229-induced brief episodes of secondary D_D001714 in a D_D003866 patient. 
Large doses of C_D014229 repeatedly induced brief episodes of D_D001714 in a D_D003866 elderly woman. 
D_D001714 excitement was coincident with the duration of action of C_D014229. 
On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the D_D009127 produced by C_D009020 in rats. 
The development of tolerance to the D_D009127 produced by C_D009020 was studied in rats. 
Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of C_D009020 (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced D_D009127 recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. 
Rats treated for 11 days with C_D009020 and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a D_D009127 after the test dose of C_D009020 that was not significantly less than in the controls and were D_D018476 (A group). 
Rats treated for 11 days with C_D009020 and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a D_D009127 after the test dose of C_D009020 that was not significantly less than in the controls and were D_D018476 (A group). 
In a further series of experiments, C_D006220 (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the D_D009127 without any dopaminergic interference. 
C_D006220 enhanced the D_D009127 in the A group. 
The results suggest that D_D009127, which is assumed to be due to an action of C_D009020 in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum. 
Compression neuropathy of the radial nerve due to C_D010423-induced D_D005355|D009135. 
D_D005355|D009135 is a common, well-known side effect of repeated C_D010423 injection. 
However, D_D009408 due to fibrotic muscle affected by C_D010423-induced D_D009135 has not previously been reported. 
However, D_D009408 due to fibrotic muscle affected by C_D010423-induced D_D009135 has not previously been reported. 
In a 37-year-old woman with documented C_D010423-induced D_D005355|D009135 of triceps and deltoid muscles bilaterally and a three-week history of right wrist drop, electrodiagnostic examination showed a severe but partial lesion of the right radial nerve distal to the branches to the triceps, in addition to the D_D005355|D009135. 
Recurrent reversible D_D058186 from C_D000666. 
A patient with cryptogenic D_D005355 and disseminated D_D013174 developed D_D058186 immediately following the administration of C_D000666 B on four separate occasions. 
We propose that C_D000666, in the setting of reduced effective arterial volume, may activate tubuloglomerular feedback, thereby contributing to D_D058186. 
Review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of C_D000638 D_D011014, immediate withdrawal of C_D000638, and prompt but continued C_D013256 therapy to ensure full recovery. 
We have reported a case of acute oliguric D_D051437 with D_D006947 in a patient with D_D005355, D_D001201, and D_D011660 after C_D007213 therapy.

Prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal, while re-exposure to a single dose of C_D007213 caused recurrence of acute reversible D_D009846. 
There was D_D010146 on i.m. injection of C_D005445 significantly more often than with isotonic saline. 
Large parenteral doses of C_D002762 (15 to 17.5 x 10(6) IU C_D002762) were associated with prolonged D_D006934, D_D054559, and large increases of C_D002762 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows. 
Large parenteral doses of C_D002762 (15 to 17.5 x 10(6) IU C_D002762) were associated with prolonged D_D006934, D_D054559, and large increases of C_D002762 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows. 
D_D010523 due to D_D044342 of C_D013831 and C_D012256 was common (10.1%) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori-D_D010523. 
D_D010523 due to D_D044342 of C_D013831 and C_D012256 was common (10.1%) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori-D_D010523. 
The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of D_D014786, D_D014987, and drowsiness were significantly less with C_D004308 than with C_D000639. 
The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of D_D014786, D_D014987, and drowsiness were significantly less with C_D004308 than with C_D000639. 
Both drugs D_D008569 but the decrease was greater for C_D003975 than C_D011433. 
Both drugs D_D008569 but the decrease was greater for C_D003975 than C_D011433. 
The co-administration of C_D001241 with C_D005200 (C_D005200) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of C_D005200-induced D_D001749 but a concomitant induction of D_D013274. 
The co-administration of C_D001241 with C_D005200 (C_D005200) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of C_D005200-induced D_D001749 but a concomitant induction of D_D013274. 
Provocation of postural D_D007022 by C_D005996 in D_D003929? 
D_D010911 were induced in F344 female rats by chronic treatment with C_D004054 (C_D004054, 8-10 mg) implanted subcutaneously in silastic capsules. 
C_D014223 D_D053040 complicating C_C020743 therapy. 
A case of C_D014223 D_D053040 is reported in a man after 4 years of hydrochlorothiazide-C_D014223 therapy for D_D006973. 
Factors affecting C_D014223 D_D053040 are discussed and 2 previously reported cases are reviewed. 
Metabolic involvement in C_D004317 D_D066126. 
The D_D066126 effects of C_D004317 were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system. 
D_D004409 and D_D003638 occurred only in rats treated during the preweaning period; within this period the greatest sensitivities for these abnormalities occurred from 2 to 11-17 and 5 to 11 days of age, respectively, indicating that the cochlea is more sensitive to C_D013307 than the site (vestibular or central) responsible for the D_D004409.

Crescentic fibrillary D_D005921 associated with intermittent C_D012293 therapy for D_D014397. 
This case study reveals an unusual finding of rapidly proliferative crescentic D_D005921 in a patient treated with C_D012293 who had no other identifiable causes for developing this disease. 
This patient underwent a 10-month regimen of C_D012293 and C_D007538 for D_D014397 and was discovered to have developed signs of severe D_D051437 five weeks after completion of therapy. 
This report documents the unusual occurrence of rapidly progressive D_D005921 with crescents and fibrillar D_D005921 in a patient treated with C_D012293. 
Time course of lipid peroxidation in C_D011692-induced D_D007674. 
Reactive C_D010100 species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute C_D011692 (C_D011692)-induced D_D007674, with antioxidants significantly reducing the D_D011507. 
Reactive C_D010100 species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute C_D011692 (C_D011692)-induced D_D007674, with antioxidants significantly reducing the D_D011507. 
This study supports the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating the D_D011507 in C_D011692 D_D007674. 
This study supports the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating the D_D011507 in C_D011692 D_D007674. 
C_D002997-induced D_D012893 does not impair its prolactin-releasing action. 
The present study was undertaken to examine the role of D_D012893, induced by C_D002997 administration, on the secretory rate of prolactin (PRL) in addition to the direct drug effect. 
D_D000799 following the intravenous administration of C_D008790. 
A history of D_D000799 secondary to C_D017706 therapy was elicited. 
During the first day of hospitalization (while intubated), intravenous C_D008790 was given, resulting in severe D_D000799. 
However, C_C007112 has failed to produce D_D001176 in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits. 
No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group; however, extensive D_D002543 occurred in all C_D009538 sulfate-treated chicks. 
In summary, the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of C_C007112-induced D_D001176. 
Epidural blood flow during C_D000527 or C_D014294 induced D_D007022. 
Epidural blood flow during C_D000527 or C_D014294 induced D_D007022. 
To evaluate the effect of C_D000527 (C_D000527) or C_D014294 (C_D014294) induced D_D007022 on epidural blood flow (EBF) during spinal surgery, EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under C_D007530 anaesthesia. 
To evaluate the effect of C_D000527 (C_D000527) or C_D014294 (C_D014294) induced D_D007022 on epidural blood flow (EBF) during spinal surgery, EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under C_D007530 anaesthesia. 
To evaluate the effect of C_D000527 (C_D000527) or C_D014294 (C_D014294) induced D_D007022 on epidural blood flow (EBF) during spinal surgery, EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under C_D007530 anaesthesia. 
After starting C_D000527 or C_D014294, MAP and rate pressure product (RPP) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values (P < 0.01), and the degree of D_D007022 due to C_D000527 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation. 
After starting C_D000527 or C_D014294, MAP and rate pressure product (RPP) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values (P < 0.01), and the degree of D_D007022 due to C_D000527 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation. 
These results suggest that C_D000527 may be preferable to C_D014294 for D_D007022 anaesthesia in spinal surgery because C_D014294 decreased EBF. 
These results suggest that C_D000527 may be preferable to C_D014294 for D_D007022 anaesthesia in spinal surgery because C_D014294 decreased EBF. 
D_D002544 were evoked by prolonged C_D010862-induced D_D013226. 
D_D002544 were evoked by prolonged C_D010862-induced D_D013226. 
Increase of D_D009069 after C_D005473 medication. 
We report the increased amount of D_D009069 in four patients with idiopathic D_D010300 after exposure to the C_D000928 C_D005473. 
C_D000082-induced D_D007022. 
However, C_D000082 has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of D_D000707, including D_D007022, in sensitive individuals. 
This article describes two D_D016638 patients in whom transient episodes of D_D007022 reproducibly developed after administration of C_D000082. 
The reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider C_D000082 in patients with D_D007022 of unknown origin. 
Acute D_D056486, D_D000744, and D_-1 induced by C_D002443. 
Acute D_D056486, D_D000744, and D_-1 induced by C_D002443. 
An 80-yr-old man developed acute D_D056486 shortly after ingesting oral C_D002443. 
The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of D_D001480, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, D_D015430, D_D012735, hepatic effects, lowered D_D012640 threshold (primarily C_D003024), and D_D000380 (C_D003024 only). 
The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of D_D001480, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, D_D015430, D_D012735, hepatic effects, lowered D_D012640 threshold (primarily C_D003024), and D_D000380 (C_D003024 only). 
The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of C_C009438 and C_C060802 on the experimental D_D013927 induced by collagen plus C_D004837 (C_D004837) in mice, and D_D001791 and D_D001778 in vitro. 
C_D014859-induced D_D061205 is accelerated by growth and C_D014807. 
The present studies demonstrate that growth and C_D014807 treatment enhance the extent of D_D061205 in rats given sufficient doses of C_D014859 to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a D_D002114 inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall. 
The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on D_D061205 in C_D014859-treated rats. 
In contrast, no D_D061205 could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of C_D014859 treatment. 
To directly examine the importance of growth to C_D014859-induced D_D061205 in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. 
Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with C_D014859 produced massive focal D_D002114 of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable D_D061205 in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. 
Although the explanation for the association between D_D061205 and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum C_D010710 and susceptibility to D_D061205, with 30% higher levels of serum C_D010710 in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to C_D014859-induced D_D061205, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats. 
This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to C_D014859-induced D_D061205 could be related to higher serum C_D010710 levels. 
The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between C_D014807 and C_D014859 in D_D061205. 
High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of D_D061205 in rats treated with C_D014807 plus C_D014859, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not C_D015055. 
C_D000928-induced D_D001714 in D_D001714 patients: identification of risk factors. 
BACKGROUND: Concerns about possible risks of switching to D_D001714 associated with C_D000928 continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for D_D001714 depression. 
Patients who experienced a D_D001714 or hypoD_D001714 switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis (DSM-IV D_D001714 I vs. D_D001714 II), number of previous D_D001714 episodes, type of C_D000928 therapy used (electroconvulsive therapy vs. C_D000928 drugs and, more particularly, selective C_D017367 [C_D017367]), use and type of mood stabilizers (C_D008094 vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi-structured Affective Temperament Interview. 
Patients who experienced a D_D001714 or hypoD_D001714 switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis (DSM-IV D_D001714 I vs. D_D001714 II), number of previous D_D001714 episodes, type of C_D000928 therapy used (electroconvulsive therapy vs. C_D000928 drugs and, more particularly, selective C_D017367 [C_D017367]), use and type of mood stabilizers (C_D008094 vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi-structured Affective Temperament Interview. 
RESULTS: Switches to hypoD_D001714 or D_D001714 occurred in 27% of all patients (N = 12) (and in 24% of the subgroup of patients treated with C_D017367 [8/33]); 16% (N = 7) experienced D_D001714 episodes, and 11% (N = 5) experienced hypoD_D001714 episodes. 
We describe a 25-year-old woman with pre-existing D_D008945 who developed intractable D_D014693 after consuming a "natural energy" guarana health drink containing a high concentration of C_D002110. 
Bladder D_D016055 as a result of continuous intravenous infusion of C_D005283: 2 case reports. 
Various reported side effects of C_D005283 administration include D_D009127, D_D007022, D_D012131, and D_D001919.

Here, 2 cases of D_D001745 leading to renal pelvocalyceal dilatation mimicking D_D006869 as a result of continuous infusion of C_D005283 are reported. 
C_D003276 and the risk of D_D009203. 
BACKGROUND: An association between the use of C_D003276 and the risk of D_D009203 has been found in some, but not all, studies. 
We investigated this association, according to the type of C_D011372 included in third-generation (i.e., C_D017135 or C_C033273) and second-generation (i.e., C_D016912) C_D003276, the dose of C_D004967, and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based, case-control study, we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first D_D009203 between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a D_D009203 and who were matched for age, calendar year of the index event, and area of residence. 
An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS: The odds ratio for D_D009203 among women who used any type of combined C_D003276, as compared with nonusers, was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.8). 
Among women who used C_D003276, the odds ratio was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.0) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 5.5) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS: The risk of D_D009203 was increased among women who used second-generation C_D003276. 
The risk of D_D009203 was similar among women who used C_D003276 whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation. 
Effects of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbal shell or core on the C_D003042-induced D_D009069 in rats. 
The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens (the shell and the core) on the D_D009069 induced by C_D003042 in rats. 
C_C103477 (0.1-10 microg/side), administered intra-accumbens shell prior to C_D003042, dose-dependently attenuated the psychostimulant-induced D_D009069. 
Our findings indicate that C_D003042 induced D_D009069 is modified by 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell, but not core, this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (C_C103477) and agonist (C_C065046), respectively.

Our patients developed D_D007565 following treatment with C_D013988 and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. 
The mechanisms of this C_D013988-induced D_D002779 are unclear. 
Epithelial C_D012964 channel (ENaC) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with C_D011692-induced D_D009404. 
We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in C_D011692 (C_D011692)-induced D_D009404. 
The time courses of urinary C_D012964 excretion, plasma C_D000450 concentration and D_D011507 were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either C_D011692 or vehicle. 
In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of C_D011692-induced D_D009404 in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by C_D000450 after day 3. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma C_D015740 (C_D015740) concentration and platelet C_D012701 (C_D012701, C_D012701) content during the immediate D_D006261 and the delayed genuine D_D008881 attack provoked by C_D005996. 
Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the C_D005996 application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the D_D008881 attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects). 
Platelet C_D012701 content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after C_D005996 in subjects with no D_D008881 attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with D_D008881 attack. 
D_D003323 after implantation of a C_D017239-eluting stent. 
We present a 43-year-old man who developed a D_D003323 in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a C_D017239-eluting stent. 
Whatever was the dose, the central administration of C_D014579 had no effect on body temperature, nociception, C_D001058-induced D_D010409 and climbing behavior, and stress-induced plasma C_D003345 level. 
Recurrent D_D055154 and C_D017255. 
We report the case of a woman complaining of D_D055154 while she was treated by C_D017255. 
To our knowledge, this is the first case of C_D017255-induced D_D055154. 
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the C_C040029-induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and C_D002211-induced D_D006930. 
C_D018817 polydrug users show process-specific central executive impairments coupled with D_D003072. 
In recent years working D_D008569 have been reported in users of C_D018817 (C_D018817, C_D018817). 
The events are consistent with a severe reaction to C_D002118 chelation by sodium C_C102006 anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic D_D006996. 
We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to D_D006996 is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to C_C102006 D_D064420. 
D_D011507 after conversion to C_D020123 in renal transplant recipients. 
More recently, D_D011507 has been reported as a consequence of C_D020123 therapy, although the mechanism has remained unclear. 
We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients, who developed or displayed increased D_D011507 after C_D020123 conversion. 
The patient cohort (14 men, 11 women) was treated with C_D020123 as conversion therapy, due to D_D051436 (D_D007674) (n = 15) D_D009369 (n = 8); D_D012514, Four D_D012878, One D_D007414, One D_D002292) or BK virus D_D007674 (n = 2). 
Heavy D_D011507 was common after the use of C_D020123 as rescue therapy for renal transplantation. 
In vitro characterization of parasympathetic and sympathetic responses in C_D003520-induced D_D003556 in the rat. 
In C_D003520-induced D_D003556 in the rat, detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered. 
However, use of C_D001569/RDs was associated with D_D004244, D_D007319 after awaking at night and D_D005221 in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger D_D003866 measured at the beginning of the hospital stay.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with more than 50% decrease in platelet count or D_D013921 (<150 x 10(9)/L) after exposure to C_D006493, who had a positive two-step antigen assay [optical density (OD) >0.4 and >50 inhibition with high concentration of C_D006493] were included in the study. 
Central D_D012170 associated with C_D002996-induced ovulation. 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of central D_D012170 associated with C_D002996 citrate (C_D002996). 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Central D_D012170 after ovulation induction with C_D002996. 
RESULT(S): A 36-year-old Chinese woman developed central D_D012170 after eight courses of C_D002996. 
A search of the literature on the D_D013923 complications of C_D002996 does not include this severe ophthalmic complication, although mild D_D014786 after C_D002996 intake is not uncommon. 
CONCLUSION(S): This is the first reported case of central D_D012170 after treatment with C_D002996. 
C_D009538-induced D_D009759 correlates with midpontine activation. 
The pathomechanism of C_D009538-induced D_D009759 (D_D009759) is unknown. 
The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back-diffusion, mast cell C_D006632 release, lipid peroxide (LPO) generation and mucosal microvascular permeability in modulating D_D006471 and D_D014456 in rats with D_D050197 induced by coadministration of C_D004872 and C_D002784.

Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1.0 ml/kg of corn oil containing C_D004872 and C_D002784 to induce D_D050197. 
Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1.0 ml/kg of corn oil containing C_D004872 and C_D002784 to induce D_D050197. 
Elevated D_D050197 parameters, such as serum C_D002118, total C_D002784 and low-density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in D_D050197 rats. 
C_D004317-induced autophagic cardiomyocyte D_D003643 plays a pathogenic role in a rat model of D_D006333. 
BACC_D011188GROUND: The mechanisms underlying D_D006333 induced by C_D004317 are very complicated and still unclear. 
The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of D_D006333 induced by C_D004317, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for D_D006333. 
METHODS: C_C025946 (C_C025946), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a D_D006333 model of rats induced by C_D004317. 
CONCLUSION: Autophagic cardiomyocyte D_D003643 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of D_D006333 in rats induced by C_D004317. 
Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of D_D006333 caused by C_D004317 via the autophagy pathway. 
D_D003221, a rather serious adverse drug reaction with C_D014635: a review of the French Pharmacovigilance database. 
INTRODUCTION: D_D003221 is an adverse drug reaction frequently observed with C_D014635. 
METHODS: Using the French Pharmacovigilance database, we selected the cases of D_D003221 reported since 1985 with C_D014635. 
RESULTS: 272 cases of D_D003221 were reported with C_D014635: 153 women and 119 men. 
D_D003221 mostly occurred during the two first weeks following C_D014635 exposure (39.7%). 
CONCLUSION: This work shows that D_D003221 with C_D014635 is a serious, rather frequent but reversible adverse drug reaction. 
Prolonged elevation of plasma C_C031942 in a cardiac transplant patient with a suspected history of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 with D_D013927. 
Prolonged elevation of plasma C_C031942 in a cardiac transplant patient with a suspected history of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 with D_D013927. 
BACKGROUND: Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 (D_D013921) or D_D013921 with D_D013927 (D_D013921T) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

C_D000995 therapy-induced D_D017114: magnitude, profile, prognosis, and predictors of outcome. 
C_D000995 therapy (ATT)-associated D_D017114 (ATT-D_D017114) is the commonest drug-induced D_D017114 in South Asia. 
The most commonly reported toxic effects of C_C110904 are D_D003967, D_D009325, D_D014839, D_D013280 and D_D060831. 
The most commonly reported toxic effects of C_C110904 are D_D003967, D_D009325, D_D014839, D_D013280 and D_D060831.

Effects of pallidal C_D009496 on C_D006220-induced D_D002375: behavioral and electrophysiological studies. 
The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal C_D009496 on C_D006220-induced D_D010302. 
RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of C_D009496 into the globus pallidus reversed C_D006220-induced D_D002375 in rats. 
This was accounted for by a significant number of D_D003866s occurring in C_D008750 treated patients with D_D001523 histories. 
Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during C_D009599-induced D_D007022. 
Ten cm C_D014867 CPAP before C_D009599 infusion produced a further D_D007022 and significantly increased heart rate and D_D002303 and QS/QT. 
C_D009599 caused significant D_D007022 and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate, but did not change cardiac output or QS/QT. 
During C_D009599 infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics, but high levels of CPAP (10 cm C_D014867), while decreasing QS/QT, produce marked D_D007022 and cardiac output. 
In addition, reflex D_D001919 caused by injected C_D009638 was significantly enhanced by C_D007980, C_D015103 had no effect on blood pressure, heart rate or reflex responses to C_D009638. 
C_D005406, a C_D004298-beta-oxidase inhibitor, did not have any effect on the D_D007022, D_D001919 or reflex-enhancing effect of C_D007980. 
However, C_D007980 restored the D_D001919 caused by C_D009638 in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate. 
C_D006916 (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex D_D001919 to C_D009638. 
C_D003042-induced D_D009203: clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations. 
Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which C_D003042 may result in acute D_D009203. 
In individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute D_D009203 may result from an increase in myocardial C_D010100 demand associated with C_D003042-induced increase in rate-pressure product. 
D_D007681 (D_D007681) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with C_D001241 and C_D000082 in female Fischer 344 rats. 
D_D007681 (D_D007681) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with C_D001241 and C_D000082 in female Fischer 344 rats. 
C_D008094-induced D_D011141 seems to be related to extrarenal as well as to renal effects. 
C_D011224-induced D_D014550. 
A case of genuine D_D014550 due to C_D011224, a common antihypertensive drug, is presented. 
Patients who present with D_D014550 while taking C_D011224 should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery, because their D_D014549 may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy. 
D_D009203 following sublingual administration of C_D007548. 
A 78-year-old with healed septal D_D009336 suffered a recurrent D_D009203 of the anterior wall following the administration of C_D007548 5 mg sublingually. 
C_D005473-induced D_D017109: clinical and theoretical implications. 
Five patients receiving C_D005473 for the treatment of D_D009771 or D_D003865 developed D_D017109. 
The typical C_D005473-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked D_D001008 were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced D_D017109. 
Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced D_D017109 in the past reported that the symptoms of C_D005473-induced D_D017109 were identical, although somewhat milder. 
D_D017109 appeared to be a common side effect of C_D005473 and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist C_D011433, dose reduction, or both. 
The authors suggest that C_D005473-induced D_D017109 may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of C_D005473-induced D_D017109 and tricyclic C_D000928-induced "jitteriness" may be identical. 
Although generally well-tolerated, asymptomatic D_D056486 have been recorded and, less commonly, severe D_D056486 induced by C_D004008. 
The patient described developed chronic active D_D056486 after six months therapy with C_D004008 which progressed despite the withdrawal of the drug, a finding not previously reported. 
These data indicate that (1) the apparent incidence of D_D020521 related to C_D003042 use is increasing; (2) C_D003042-associated D_D020521 occurs primarily in young adults; (3) D_D020521 may follow any route of C_D003042 administration; (4) D_D020521 after C_D003042 use is frequently associated with D_D002532 and D_D001165; and (5) in C_D003042-associated D_D020521, the frequency of D_D020300 exceeds that of D_D002544. 
C_D005905-induced D_D056486. 
For C_D005905, a second-generation C_D013453, only two brief reports of D_D056486 exist. 
Two patients with D_D003924 developed an acute D_D056486-like syndrome soon after initiation of C_D005905 therapy. 
C_D005905 can produce an acute D_D056486-like illness in some persons. 
Systolic pressure variation is greater during D_D006470 than during C_D009599-induced D_D007022 in ventilated dogs. 
During D_D006470-induced D_D007022 the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the C_D009599 group. 
The SPV during D_D007022 was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in the D_D006470 group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the C_D009599 group (P less than 0.02). 
The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the D_D006470 and C_D009599 groups, respectively, during D_D007022 (P less than 0.02). 
Cerebral blood flow and metabolism during C_D007530-induced D_D007022 in patients subjected to surgery for D_D002532. 
Cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for C_D010100 were measured during C_D007530-induced D_D007022 in 10 patients subjected to craniotomy for clipping of a D_D002532. 
Controlled D_D007022 to an average MAP of 50-55 mm C_D008628 was induced by increasing the dose of C_D007530, and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2.2 +/- 0.2%. 
An D_D004342 consisting of D_D000799 secondary to continuous infusion C_D005472 occurred in a patient with recurrent D_D009062, D_D005355, and C_D002945-induced D_D007674. 
An D_D004342 consisting of D_D000799 secondary to continuous infusion C_D005472 occurred in a patient with recurrent D_D009062, D_D005355, and C_D002945-induced D_D007674. 
C_D000638-induced D_D012848. 
We observed D_D012848 due to chronic C_D000638 administration in a 5-year-old boy with D_D009202, D_D014927 and D_D013617. 
Reduction in the dosage of C_D000638 resulted in the disappearance of the D_D012848 and the persistence of asymptomatic D_D012804. 
D_D006504 after C_D003606 therapy (C_D003606) for D_D008545. 
A case of D_D006504 with fatal outcome after C_D003606 (C_D003606) therapy for D_D008545 is reported. 
A case of D_D004409 caused by C_D008787. 
D_D004409 appeared in the mouth, tongue, neck and abdomen of a 64-year-old male patient after he took C_D008787 for D_D005767 in a regimen of 30 mg per day for a total of about 260 days. 
When the C_D008787 administration was discontinued, the D_D004409 gradually improved to a considerable extent. 
A case is presented of a reversible D_D006327 occurring under C_D000638 treatment for D_D013617 in a patient without clear D_D006345. 
C_D002066-induced hemorrhagic D_D003556. 
A case of a C_D002066-induced hemorrhage D_D003556 is reported. 
The similarity between the histologic appearances of C_D002066 D_D003556 and both radiation and C_D003520-induced D_D003556 is discussed and the world literature reviewed.

The role of the renin--C_D000809 system in the maintenance of blood pressure during C_D006221 anesthesia and C_D009599 (C_D009599)-induced D_D007022 was evaluated. 
The role of the renin--C_D000809 system in the maintenance of blood pressure during C_D006221 anesthesia and C_D009599 (C_D009599)-induced D_D007022 was evaluated. 
This demonstrates the participation of the renin--C_D000809 system in antagonizing the combined D_D007022 effects of C_D006221 and C_D009599.

Two patients had a D_D002779 D_D056486 induced by C_D002231 (C_D002231). 
Two patients had a D_D002779 D_D056486 induced by C_D002231 (C_D002231). 
Two others had a mixed (D_D002779 and cytolytic) D_D056486 following C_D002231. 
Two others had a mixed (D_D002779 and cytolytic) D_D056486 following C_D002231. 
One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic D_D056486 which appeared after C_C019269 (C_C019269) had replaced C_D002231. 
A prospective, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of C_D014805 and C_D002955 supplementation in preventing C_D015215 (C_D015215)-induced D_D001855. 
Acute D_D003221 induced by a high-dose infusion of C_D005472 and C_D002955. 
Acute D_D003221 induced by a high-dose infusion of C_D005472 and C_D002955. 
He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental D_D003221, D_D003221 and D_D001523, and then lapsed into a deep D_D003128, lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of C_D005472 and C_D002955 infusion.

Immediate D_D004342 to C_D000658. 
A detailed clinical history, together with skin tests, RAST (radioallergosorbent test), and controlled challenge tests, was used to establish whether patients D_D004342 to C_D047090 antibiotics had selective immediate D_D004342 responses to C_D000658 (C_D000658) or were cross-reacting with other C_D010406 derivatives. 
We selected the 54 (30.5%) cases of immediate C_D000658 D_D004342 with good tolerance of C_D010400. 
Challenge tests with C_D000658 were performed in 23 subjects (43%) to establish the diagnosis of immediate D_D004342 reaction to C_D000658, and in 15 cases (28%) both skin test and RAST for C_D000658 were negative. 
We describe the largest group of C_D000658-D_D004342 patients who have tolerated C_D010400 reported so far. 
Persistent D_D010243 after prolonged use of C_D001279 in the absence of corticosteroids. 
Reports of persistent D_D010243 after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid-based NMBAs such as C_D014673, especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids. 
C_D001279, a short-acting C_-1 NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function, has also been associated with persistent D_D010243, but only when used with corticosteroids. 
We report a case of C_D001279-related D_D010243 persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids. 
Habitual use of C_D000082 as a risk factor for D_D007676: a comparison with C_D010615. 
Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of C_D010615 is associated with the development of D_D007676 and D_D007676 (D_D007676), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19. 
These studies suggest that both C_D010615 and C_D000082 may contribute to the burden of D_D007676, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. 
Reduction of C_D006497-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with C_D013311-induced D_D003928. 
C_D008094-associated D_D003072 reduced by a switch to C_D014635: a case series. 
Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of C_D008094, such as D_D011141 and D_D014202, more subtle C_D008094 side effects such as D_D003072, D_D003072, and D_D003072 remain understudied. 
Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of C_D008094, such as D_D011141 and D_D014202, more subtle C_D008094 side effects such as D_D003072, D_D003072, and D_D003072 remain understudied. 
This report summarizes our experience in switching D_D001714 patients from C_D008094 to C_D014635 to alleviate such cognitive and D_D003072. 
RESULTS: We report seven cases where substitution of C_D008094, either fully or partially, with C_D014635 was extremely helpful in reducing the D_D003072 attributed to C_D008094 in our D_D001714 patients. 
CONCLUSION: In this preliminary report, C_D014635 was a superior alternative to C_D008094 in D_D001714 patients experiencing D_D003072, D_D003072, and D_D003072. 
Upregulation of the expression of C_D014667 gene in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the C_D008094-induced D_D003919 rat. 
The expression of arginine C_D014667 (C_D001127) gene in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) was investigated in rats with C_D008094 (C_D008094)-induced D_D011141, using in situ hybridization histochemistry and radioimmunoassay. 
The male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained C_D008094Cl (60 mmol/kg) for 4 weeks developed marked D_D011141. 
These results suggest that D_D003681 and/or the activation of visceral afferent inputs may contribute to the elevation of plasma C_D001127 and the upregulation of C_D001127 gene expression in the PVN and the SON of the C_D008094-induced D_D003919 rat. 
C_D013390-induced D_D006323 and D_D003643 following 5 days of immobilization. 
The present report describes a case of D_D006323 and subsequent D_D003643 as a result of D_D006947 following the use of C_D013390 in a 23-year-old Malawian woman. 
The present report describes a case of D_D006323 and subsequent D_D003643 as a result of D_D006947 following the use of C_D013390 in a 23-year-old Malawian woman. 
Forty seconds after injection of C_D013390, D_D001919 and D_D006323 occurred. 
Forty seconds after injection of C_D013390, D_D001919 and D_D006323 occurred. 
Apart from the reduction in the patient's level of consciousness, there were no signs of motor neurone damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for D_D006947 following the administration of C_D013390. 
It is postulated that her D_D003643 was caused by D_D004342 to C_D013390, associated with her 5-day immobilization. 
An D_D006973, accompanied by D_D001281, D_D011595, D_D019954 and D_D014474, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with C_D008619 850 mg containing C_D004837 0.225 mg, for correction of D_D004387.

RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent D_D005922 (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 (n = 9), and mild-type C_D016559 D_D007674 (n = 11). 
Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674, respectively. 
Chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), D_D005923 (4 biopsies) and the striped form of D_D005355 (11 biopsies). 
Chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), D_D005923 (4 biopsies) and the striped form of D_D005355 (11 biopsies). 
The serum C_D003404 levels of patients in the mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic C_D016559-D_D007674 group (P< 0.001). 
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic C_D016559 D_D007674 is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function. 
In the mouse passive-avoidance test, C_C087567 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented D_D000647 induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug C_D012601 and the M1-selective antagonist C_C098725.

D_D000799 due to C_D000806: common and inadequately diagnosed. 
The estimated incidence of D_D000799 during C_D000806 treatment is between 1 and 7 per thousand patients. 
Recurrent use of newer C_D003276 and the risk of D_D054556. 
The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of D_D054556 (D_D054556) associated with newer C_D003276 (C_D003276) did not distinguish between patterns of C_D003276 use, namely first-time users, repeaters and switchers. 
The adjusted rate ratio of D_D054556 for repeat users of third generation C_D003276 was 0.6 (95% CI:0.3-1.2) relative to repeat users of second generation pills, whereas it was 1.3 (95% CI:0.7-2.4) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills. 
Development of C_D001058-induced D_D010554: comparison of adult male and female Wistar rats. 
The development of C_D001058-induced (1.0 mg/kg s.c. once daily) D_D010554 of adult male and female Wistar rats obtained from the same breeder was studied in two consecutive sets. 
In male animals, repeated C_D001058 treatment induced a gradual development of D_D010554 as evidenced by the increased intensity of D_D010554 and shortened latency before the first attack toward the opponent. 
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates gender differences in the development of the C_D001058-induced D_D010554 and indicates that the female rats do not fill the validation criteria for use in this method. 
C_D018490 and D_D014549. 
This concerns 2 male patients who experienced D_D014549 while taking C_C047426. 
In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed D_D014549 secondary to the selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitors C_D017374 and C_D020280, as well as a third who developed this side effect on C_C047426.

In 2 of the 3 cases the patients were also taking C_D016651 and beta-blockers, both of which could have contributed to the D_D014549. 
Animal studies suggest that D_D014549 secondary to C_D018490 could be mediated by the 5HT4 receptors found on the bladder. 
D_D007022 following the initiation of C_C023754 in a patient treated with an C_D000809 converting enzyme inhibitor for chronic D_D006973. 
The authors present a 10-year-old boy chronically treated with C_D017706, an C_D000809 converting enzyme inhibitor, to control D_D006973 who developed D_D007022 following the addition of C_C023754, an alpha-2 agonist, for the treatment of D_D009128.

These 13 included cases of D_D006974, D_D057049, D_D008181, D_D011695, crescentic D_D005921, and C_D003042-related D_D058186. 
In behavioral studies, pre-treatment of mice with C_-1, C_C093337, or C_-1 significantly attenuated C_D003042-induced D_D012640 and lethality. 
To further validate the hypothesis that the anti-C_D003042 effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense C_D009838 against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the D_D012640 and locomotor stimulatory effects of C_D003042. 
D_D016171 is a side-effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market (e.g. C_D016593 and C_C010637).

Intravenous administration of C_D011346 by 15-minute infusion versus 2-minute bolus does not affect the incidence of D_D017109: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. 
STUDY OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the rate of D_D017109 after administration of intravenous C_D011346 as a 2-minute bolus or 15-minute infusion. 
CONCLUSION: A 50% reduction in the incidence of D_D017109 when C_D011346 was administered by means of 15-minute intravenous infusion versus a 2-minute intravenous push was not detected. 
C_D000961 in the treatment of C_D010396-induced D_D000741. 
A patient who received C_D000961 therapy for D_D000741 due to C_D010396 therapy is described. 
Use of C_D000961 may be the optimal treatment of C_D010396-induced D_D000741. 
RESULTS: Sensitivity to several D_D012640 endpoints induced by C_D009538, C_D002217, and C_D009388 were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice.

Prenatal C_D003907 programs D_D006973 and D_D007674 in the rat. 
Prenatal C_D003907 programs D_D006973 and D_D007674 in the rat. 
The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal C_D003907 programmed a progressive D_D006973 and D_D007674 in rats. 
The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal C_D003907 programmed a progressive D_D006973 and D_D007674 in rats. 
Offspring of rats administered C_D003907 on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% D_D007674 compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (22 527+/-509 versus 28 050+/-561, P<0.05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age. 
Male rats that received prenatal C_D003907 on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had D_D006973 at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a D_D007674. 
Male rats that received prenatal C_D003907 on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had D_D006973 at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a D_D007674. 
This study shows that prenatal C_D003907 in rats results in a D_D007674, D_D005921, and D_D006973 when administered at specific points during gestation.

The risk of D_D054556 in women prescribed C_D017373 in combination with C_D004997: a nested cohort analysis and case-control study. 
The risk of D_D054556 in women prescribed C_D017373 in combination with C_D004997: a nested cohort analysis and case-control study. 
Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of D_D054556 (D_D054556) associated with C_D017373/C_D004997 compared with conventional combined C_D003276 (COCs).

METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with D_D000152, D_D006628 or D_D011085 to estimate the risk of D_D054556 associated with C_D017373/C_D004997. 
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated an increased risk of D_D054556 associated with the use of C_D017373/C_D004997 in women with D_D000152, D_D006628 or D_D011085 although residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded. 
All patients received CAB [C_D016729 (C_D016729) 3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg C_D005485, tid, per Os] and were evaluated for D_D000740 by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB).

Reversible D_D002311 related to C_D000666 therapy. 
We describe a patient who developed D_D002311 and clinical congestive D_D006333 after 2 months of therapy with C_D000666 (C_D000666) for disseminated D_D003047. 
We describe a patient who developed D_D002311 and clinical congestive D_D006333 after 2 months of therapy with C_D000666 (C_D000666) for disseminated D_D003047. 
His echocardiographic abnormalities and D_D006333 resolved after C_C101425 was substituted for C_D000666. 
Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that products containing C_D011803 may produce D_D002493, including D_D003221, altered mental status, D_D012640, and D_D003128, particularly in older women.

In sham-operated rats, C_C032302 or C_D008750 elicited similar D_D007022 that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure. 
In sham-operated rats, C_C032302 or C_D008750 elicited similar D_D007022 that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure. 
Ovx significantly enhanced the D_D007022 response to C_D008750, in contrast to no effect on C_C032302 D_D007022. 
Ovx significantly enhanced the D_D007022 response to C_D008750, in contrast to no effect on C_C032302 D_D007022. 
The enhanced C_D008750 D_D007022 in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and D_D001523. 
These findings suggest that C_D004967 downregulates alpha2- but not I1-receptor-mediated D_D007022 and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in C_D008750-C_D004967 interaction. 
Cardioprotective effect of C_C007145 on C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats. 
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, C_D020849 was associated with an increased risk for D_D054556 (relative risk [RR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.8). 
CONCLUSION: C_D020849 was associated with an increased risk for D_D054556, but there was no increased risk for D_D002386, D_D005705, D_D004714, or D_D016889. 
C_D002443-associated D_D001660 in paediatric surgical patients. 
It is well known that C_D002443 leads to D_D001660 in some patients. 
In this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of D_D001660 in paediatric surgical patients receiving C_D002443 treatment, who often had to fast in the post-operative period. 
Significant blockade of C_D003042 D_D064420 was observed with the higher dose of C_-1 (190 mg/kg), where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40%, D_D012640 up to 77% and D_D003643 by 72%. 
CONCLUSION: We suggest that the increased risk of D_D054556 due to C_D020849 treatment may be related to increased tPA levels, but not TAFI levels. 
C_D007654 induced D_D016171 without concomitant use of QT interval-prolonging drug. 
We report a woman with D_D003324 who developed a markedly D_D008133 and D_D016171 (D_D016171) after taking C_D007654 for treatment of D_D009181. 
We report a woman with D_D003324 who developed a markedly D_D008133 and D_D016171 (D_D016171) after taking C_D007654 for treatment of D_D009181. 
We postulate that by virtue of its direct blocking action on IKr, C_D007654 alone may prolong QT interval and induce D_D016171. 
This calls for attention when C_D007654 is administered to patients with risk factors for acquired D_D008133. 
C_D003975-, C_D012601- and ageing-induced D_D000647 served as the interoceptive behavioral models. 
C_D003975-, C_D012601- and ageing-induced D_D000647 served as the interoceptive behavioral models. 
Furthermore, C_D010936 reversed the D_D000647 induced by C_D012601 (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and C_D003975 (1 mg/kg, i.p.). 
Furthermore, C_D010936 reversed the D_D000647 induced by C_D012601 (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and C_D003975 (1 mg/kg, i.p.). 
The following case is a report of D_D011128 possibly caused by epidural injection of C_D014221 and C_D002045. 
High-dose C_D013739 is associated with D_D050197 in postmenopausal women. 
METHODS: In a population-based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54-67 years, we studied the association between self-reported intramuscularly administered high-dose C_D004967-C_D013739 therapy (estradiol- and C_D013739 esters) and aortic D_D050197. 
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high-dose C_D013739 therapy may adversely affect D_D050197 in postmenopausal women and indicate that androgen replacement in these women may not be harmless. 
C_D020123-associated D_D011507 and D_D007674. 
C_D020123-associated D_D011507 and D_D007674. 
C_D020123 represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft D_D007674. 
Because C_D020123 does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-D_D007674 drug'. 
However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, C_D020123 is associated with D_D011507 and acute D_D007674. 
However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, C_D020123 is associated with D_D011507 and acute D_D007674. 
The mechanisms of C_D020123-associated D_D011507 are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. 
The acute D_D007674 associated with C_D020123 (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. 
Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of C_D020123 on the kidney, the use of C_D020123 in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of D_D011507 and renal function, use of C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitors or C_D000809 II receptor blockers if D_D011507 occurs and withdrawal if needed. 
Progressive D_D009135 with up-regulation of MHC-I associated with C_D019821 therapy. 
C_D019821 can cause a necrotizing D_D009135 and D_-1 which is reversible on cessation of the drug. 
What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby C_D019821s may induce a D_D009135, which persists or may progress after stopping the drug. 
These observations suggest that C_D019821s may initiate an immune-mediated D_D009135 that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy. 
The mechanism of this D_D009135 is uncertain but may involve the induction by C_D019821s of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up-regulation of MHC-I expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres. 
C_D003000-induced D_D001919 in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. 
The influence of C_D012906 during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although C_D012906 has been positively associated with D_D034381 in adults. 
D_D020078 and D_D001523 after neonatal C_D013726 treatment in rats: implications for D_D001321. 
C_D013726, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest D_D007752, has been associated with increased concordance for D_D001321 in dizygotic twins. 
Acute D_D009205 associated with C_D003024. 
OBJECTIVE: A case of acute D_D009205 associated with the commencement of C_D003024 is described, highlighting the onset, course and possible contributing factors. 
RESULTS: A 20-year-old male with D_D012559 developed a sudden onset of D_D009205 after commencement of C_D003024. 
CONCLUSIONS: D_D009205 is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of C_D003024. 
D_D001927 induced by C_C026098 added to C_D014635. 
D_D001927 induced by C_C026098 added to C_D014635. 
BACKGROUND: We report on the manifestation of a C_C026098 (C_C026098)-induced D_D001927. 
C_D009638 signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of C_D003042-induced D_D001008. 
While the mechanisms underlying C_D003042's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by C_D003042, such as D_D001008. 
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of C_D004298 beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack C_D009638 (C_D009638), in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to C_D003042-induced D_D001008. 
RESULTS: We found that C_D003042 dose-dependently increased D_D001008-like behavior in control (Dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. 
C_D003042-induced D_D001008 was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of C_D004221, a C_D004298 beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. 
In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist C_D011433 blocked C_D003042-induced D_D001008-like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist C_D011224 and the alpha(2) antagonist C_D015016 had no effect. 
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta-adrenergic receptors is required for C_D003042-induced D_D001008 in mice. 
RESULTS: There were more incidents of D_D001919 in subjects treated with C_D003000 compared with those not treated with C_D003000 (17.5% versus 3.4%; p =.02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes. 
Physicians prescribing C_D003000 should monitor for D_D001919 and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial D_D006970. 
A 45-year-old man, an admitted frequent C_D003042 user, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) on two separate occasions with a history of D_D011317 after C_D003042 use. 
Effect of C_D010936 and C_D014810 combination in C_D007545 induced D_D009203 in rats. 
The present study was aimed to investigate the combined effects of C_D010936 and C_D014810 on heart weight, body weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, endogenous antioxidants and membrane bound ATPases in C_D007545 (C_D007545)-induced D_D009203 in rats. 
These findings indicate the synergistic protective effect of C_D010936 and C_D014810 during C_D007545 induced D_D009203 in rats. 
Development of D_D009157 during C_C417083 and C_D012254 treatment for D_D019698. 
Development of D_D009157 during C_C417083 and C_D012254 treatment for D_D019698. 
The D_D009157 associated with combination therapy of C_C417083 and C_D012254 for D_D019698 is very rarely reported; therefore, we present this case with a review of the various eye complications of C_C417083 therapy.

This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of C_-1, with a particular focus on models of D_D006948, involving either drug challenge (ie, C_D000661 and C_D016291) or transgenic mice (ie, C_D016202 Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)). 
This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of C_-1, with a particular focus on models of D_D006948, involving either drug challenge (ie, C_D000661 and C_D016291) or transgenic mice (ie, C_D016202 Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)). 
Results showed that C_-1 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked D_D006948 induced by the non-competitive C_D016202 receptor antagonist, C_D016291 and partially reversed spontaneous D_D006948 of C_D016202 Nr1(neo-/-) mice. 
In contrast, C_-1 failed to affect D_D006948 induced by C_D000661 or naturally observed in C_D004298 transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.). 
C_D010656 but not C_D004809 D_D002534 following anesthesia-induced D_D007022. 
RESULTS: C_D002997 exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced D_D001008 (elevated plus maze and marble burying), D_-1 (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working D_D008569 (e.g., win-shift paradigm), D_D060845, and D_-1.

A case is reported of the D_D006463 (D_D006463) in a woman taking C_D003276. 
Effects of C_D001241, C_D004176, and C_D006854 on C_D004837-induced D_D009202 in dogs. 
A reproducible model for producing diffuse D_D009202 (C_D004837 infusion) has been developed to study the cardioprotective effects of agents or maneuvers which might alter the evolution of acute D_D009203. 
Eight D_D005901 patients chronically treated with C_D013999 0.5%/12h, suffering from D_D003866 diagnosed through DMS-III-R criteria, were included in the study. 
In a double blind cross-over study with control group, the patients under C_D013999 treatment presented higher D_D003866 values measured through the Beck and the Zung-Conde scales (p < 0.001 vs control). 
These results suggest that C_D015784 could be less of a D_D003866-inducer than C_D013999 in predisposed patients. 
Long-term follow-up of C_D007069 D_D007674 in children treated for D_C535700: an International Society of Pediatric Oncology report. 
This low percentage (5%) of D_D005198 must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of C_D007069 in the treatment of mesenchymal D_D009369s in children. 
Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 C_D004298 receptors in mediating C_D009538-induced D_D006948 in rats. 
C_D009538 (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant D_D006948 in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment. 
C_D009538-induced D_D006948 was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist C_C534628, the selective D2 antagonist C_D020891 and the D1/D2 antagonist C_D005476. 
Pretreatment with the D2 agonist C_-1 enhanced C_D009538-induced D_D006948, whereas the D1 agonist C_D015647 had no effect. 
The results indicate that acute C_D009538 injection induces a pronounced D_D006948 in rats habituated to the test environment. 
Reduction in injection D_D010146 using buffered C_D008012 as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization. 
Previous reports have suggested that D_D010146 associated with the injection of C_D008012 is related to the acidic pH of the solution. 
To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of C_D008012 into the physiologic range would reduce D_D010146 during injection, we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. 
Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of D_D010146 after receiving standard C_D008012 in one femoral area and buffered C_D008012 in the opposite femoral area. 
The mean D_D010146 score for buffered C_D008012 was significantly lower than the mean score for standard C_D008012 (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03). 
The pH adjustment of standard C_D008012 can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the D_D010146 occurring during the infiltration of tissues. 
Side effects attributable to C_D008454 included D_D001068 (36%), D_D014987 (10%), behavioral change (22%), and D_D012817 (18%); C_D008454 dosage was reduced in 43% of patients.

C_D010431 (C_D010431) does not inhibit C_D004176-induced coronary D_D006940: implications for C_D004176-C_D013793-201 myocardial imaging. 
Many of these patients are taking C_D010431 (C_D010431), a C_C008514 derivative which may improve D_D007383. 
Whether C_D010431 inhibits C_D004176-induced coronary D_D006940 like other C_C008514s such as C_D013806 and should be stopped prior to C_D004176-C_D013793-201 imaging is unknown. 
Neither dose of C_D010431 significantly decreased the C_D004176-induced D_D006940, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after C_D013806 (p less than 0.01). 
We conclude that C_D010431 does not inhibit C_D004176-induced coronary D_D006940 even at high doses. 
The low incidence of D_D002543 as a cause of D_D003643 in patients with D_D010300 may reflect the D_D007022 effect of C_D007980 and a D_D007022 mechanism due to reduced C_D009638 levels in the D_D010300 brain. 
From these results, we conclude that C_D012254 has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of D_D006478, and that D_D000740, the only secondary reaction observed, can be easily managed. 
D_D000787 and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral C_D004176 in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization procedures. 
C_D009599-induced D_D007022 evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (irCRF) into the hypophysial-portal circulation. 
Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to C_D009599-induced D_D007022 is observed and occurs at a plasma C_D003345 level between 8-12 micrograms/dl. 
Noradrenergic involvement in D_D002375 induced by C_D013759. 
These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of D_D002375 induced by C_D013759, whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in D_D002375 induced by C_D006220. 
These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of D_D002375 induced by C_D013759, whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in D_D002375 induced by C_D006220. 
Intracranial pressure increases during C_D015760-induced D_D009127. 
Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured during C_D015760-induced D_D009127 in rats. 
These observations suggest that D_D009127 should be prevented when C_D015760, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems. 
It is concluded that patients on C_D005472 treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if D_D002637 or D_D013610 is observed. 
C_D014700-induced C_D002220 D_D020258. 
C_D014700-induced C_D002220 D_D020258. 
Two patients with signs of C_D002220 D_D020258 after combined treatment with C_D014700 showed complete recovery after discontinuation of the C_D002118 entry blocker. 
Two patients with signs of C_D002220 D_D020258 after combined treatment with C_D014700 showed complete recovery after discontinuation of the C_D002118 entry blocker. 
In contrast, dosages of C_C005238 (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of D_D013118 in only 9% of the animals. 
D_D002544 with a single oral dose of C_D010665. 
We report the case of a young woman who suffered a D_D002544 after taking a single oral dose of C_D010665. 
Maternal C_D008094 and neonatal D_D004437: evaluation with cross-sectional echocardiography. 
The effects of exercise on the severity of C_D007545-induced D_D009203 were studied in female albino rats of 20,40,60 and 80 weeks of age. 
Light microscopic analysis showed a significant protection against C_D004317-induced D_D009202. 
Intrarenal infusion of C_D009638 caused D_D006973 at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously. 
These results suggest that D_D006973 after chronic intrarenal C_D009638 infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating C_D009638 and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism. 
There was only one case of D_D003704 possibly due to C_D002927 (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had C_D002927 levels above 1.25 microgram/ml. 
Thus, high C_D002927 levels alone do not always induce D_D003704. 
Development of D_D018262 in C_D004054-exposed offspring under observation. 
Two cases of D_D018262 of the vagina detected at follow-up in young women exposed in utero to C_D004054 are reported. 
C_D010634-induced D_D006529 in the rat: its relationship to C_D002251-induced D_D005355. 
The yield of severe D_D005355 of the liver (defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology, D_D001201 greater than 30 ml, plasma albumin less than 2.2 g/dl, D_D013163 2-3 times normal, and testicular D_D001284 approximately half normal weight) after 12 doses of C_D002251 given intragastrically in the C_D010634-primed rat was increased from 25% to 56% by giving the initial "calibrating" dose of C_D002251 at the peak of the C_D010634-induced D_D006529. 
Attenuation of the C_D008094-induced D_D003919 by C_D000584 in rats. 
The effect of C_D000584 on C_D008094-induced D_D059606 and D_D011141 and on the C_D008094 concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with C_D018021. 
The effect of C_D000584 on C_D008094-induced D_D059606 and D_D011141 and on the C_D008094 concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with C_D018021. 
In all the experiments, the attenuation of the C_D008094-induced D_D003919 by C_D000584 was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the C_D008094 concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma C_D011188 level. 
It is concluded that acute C_D000584 administration to C_D008094-treated patients suffering from D_D059606 and D_D011141 might relieve these patients but prolonged C_D000584 supplementation would result in elevated C_D008094 levels and might be hazardous. 
Compared with placebo subjects, C_D000525 patients developed more adverse reactions (21% v. 0%) of D_D003866, D_D004775, disinhibition and D_D001523; and more side-effects, particularly sedation, D_D001523, D_D008569, D_D015431 and D_D001259.

C_D019808 prevents the development of C_D011692-induced D_D009401. 
The appearance of D_D009404 such as D_D011507, D_D034141, D_D006937 and increase in C_D001806, induced in rats by injection of C_D011692 was markedly inhibited by oral administration of C_D019808 (C_D019808), a novel C_D000804 receptor antagonist, at a dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg per day.

The results suggest a possible involvement of the renin-C_D000809 system in the development of C_D011692-induced D_D009401. 
Prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (C_D015282) on gallbladder function and D_D042882 formation in Chinese D_D000172 patients. 
During treatment with C_D015282, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had D_D042882s, and 1 developed D_D041881 requiring surgery. 
During treatment with C_D015282, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had D_D042882s, and 1 developed D_D041881 requiring surgery. 
After withdrawal of C_D015282 in 10 patients without D_D042882s, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. 
Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, D_D042882s, and D_D002764 during C_D015282 therapy in Chinese D_D000172 patients. 
Improvement of C_D007980-induced D_D004409 by C_D011433 in D_D010300. 
This study suggests that administration of low doses of beta-blockers may improve C_D007980-induced ballistic and choreic D_D004409 in D_D010300. 
Morphological features of D_D001927 after chronic administration of the antiepileptic drug C_D014635 to rats. 
Long-term intragastric application of the antiepileptic drug sodium C_D014635 (Vupral "Polfa") at the effective dose of 200 mg/kg b. w. once daily to rats for 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months revealed D_D009422 indicating D_D002526 ("C_D014635 D_D001927"). 
The possible influence of the D_D056486, mainly D_D022124, upon the development of C_D014635 D_D001927 is discussed.

Iatrogenically induced intractable D_D013611 after C_D014700 and catheter ablation in a patient with D_D014927 and D_D002311. 
QRS without preexcitation, caused by junctional escape beats after C_D014700 or unidirectional antegrade block of accessory pathway after catheter ablation, established frequent D_D013611 attack. 
We investigated an epidemic of D_D008107 in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of C_C067411 (C_C067411) and C_C072959 (C_C072959). 
We investigated an epidemic of D_D008107 in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of C_C067411 (C_C067411) and C_C072959 (C_C072959). 
Patients given C_D011318 were more likely to develop D_D034381 (10 out of 22) than those given C_D002045 (4 out of 22) (P < 0.05). 
Patients given C_D011318 were more likely to develop D_D034381 (10 out of 22) than those given C_D002045 (4 out of 22) (P < 0.05). 
The average D_D034381 for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after C_D011318 and 15 dB after C_D002045. 
The average D_D034381 for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after C_D011318 and 15 dB after C_D002045. 
C_D008614-associated D_D012640 in a healthy adolescent receiving C_D008614 for D_D010149 control. 
A previously healthy child who developed acute, severe, rapidly progressive D_D001649 syndrome shortly after D_D013262 is described; this was temporally associated with C_D007052 use. 
High incidence of D_D006976 associated with C_D001067 in Belgium. 
D_D006976 is a rare, progressive and incurable disease, which has been associated with the intake of C_D001067 drugs. 
In 8 patients the diagnosis of D_D006976 was uncertain, 5 of them had taken C_D001067. 
A policy of unrestricted prescription of C_D001067 may lead to a high incidence of associated D_D006976. 
D_D002819 associated with rapid adjustment to C_D008691. 
This is a case report of euphoria and D_D002819 both transiently induced by rapid adjustment to the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist C_D008691 in an inpatient previously abusing C_D003932 and C_D003042. 
This is a case report of euphoria and D_D002819 both transiently induced by rapid adjustment to the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist C_D008691 in an inpatient previously abusing C_D003932 and C_D003042. 
C_D003042-induced D_D019964: prevalence rates and D_D001523 symptoms in an outpatient C_D003042-dependent sample. 
243 C_D003042-dependent outpatients with C_D003042-induced D_D019964 (D_D019970), other D_D019964s, or no D_D019964 were compared on measures of D_D001523 symptoms. 
D_D006461 of human erythrocytes induced by C_D013629 is related to disruption of membrane structure. 
C_D013629 (C_D013629), the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of D_D001943, induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and D_D000743. 
This work evaluates the effects of C_D013629 on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on C_D013629-induced D_D000743 and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms. 
C_D013629 induces D_D006461 of erythrocytes as a function of concentration. 
The extension of D_D006461 is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 microM C_D013629 induces total D_D006461 of all tested suspensions. 
The D_D006461 effect of C_D013629 is prevented by low concentrations of C_D024502 (C_D024502) and C_D024502 acetate (C_D024502Ac) (inactivated functional C_D017665) indicating that C_D013629-induced D_D006461 is not related to oxidative membrane damage. 
This was further evidenced by absence of C_D010100 consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with C_D013629-induced D_D006461. 
D_D006461 caused by C_D013629 was not preceded by the leakage of C_D011188(+) from the cells, also excluding a colloid-osmotic type mechanism of D_D006461, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves. 
These effects suggest that the protection from D_D006461 by C_D024505 is related to a decreased C_D013629 incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided. 
Therefore, C_D013629-induced D_D006461 results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane. 
These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by C_D013629, resulting in D_D000743. 
Changes of C_D012964 and C_D000255 affinities of the cardiac (C_D012964,C_D011188)-C_D000255ase during and after C_D009569 deficient D_D006973. 
Inhibition of C_D009569 synthesis induces sustained D_D006973. 
To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of C_D012964+, we studied the response of cardiac (C_D012964,C_D011188)-C_D000255ase to C_D009569-deficient D_D006973 induced in rats by C_D009569-synthase inhibition with 40 mg/kg/day C_D019331 (C_D019331) for 4 four weeks. 
Inhibition of C_D009569-synthase induced a reversible D_D006973 accompanied by D_D003866 C_D012964+-extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated C_D012964+-binding properties of the (C_D012964,C_D011188)-C_D000255ase. 
Effects of long-term pretreatment with C_D007545 on C_D001971-induced D_D013610 in conscious rats. 
Effects of long-term pretreatment with C_D007545 on C_D001971-induced D_D013610 in conscious rats. 
It has been shown that C_D001971-induced D_D013610, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central C_D004298 D2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day C_D007545 pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart.

This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with C_D007545 could abolish C_D001971-induced D_D013610 in conscious rats. 
This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with C_D007545 could abolish C_D001971-induced D_D013610 in conscious rats. 
C_D007545 pretreatment for 15 days caused D_D006332 without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate. 
In control rats, intravenous C_D001971 (150 microg/kg) induced significant D_D007022 and D_D013610. 
In control rats, intravenous C_D001971 (150 microg/kg) induced significant D_D007022 and D_D013610. 
C_D001971-induced D_D007022 was unaffected by C_D007545 pretreatment, while D_D013610 was reversed to significant D_D001919, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. C_D004294 (0.5 mg/kg). 
C_D001971-induced D_D007022 was unaffected by C_D007545 pretreatment, while D_D013610 was reversed to significant D_D001919, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. C_D004294 (0.5 mg/kg).

These results show that 15-day C_D007545 pretreatment not only abolished but reversed C_D001971-induced D_D013610 to D_D001919, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart.

They suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central D_D013610 of C_D001971 appears to predominate and to mask the D_D001919 of this agonist at peripheral C_D004298 D2 receptors. 
Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that C_D003000 induces sympathetic withdrawal and D_D001919, we hypothesized that C_D003000's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other. 
Age-related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and C_D003000-induced D_D001919. 
Differential effects of systemically administered C_D007649 and C_D008012 on dynamic and static D_D006930 induced by intradermal C_D002211 in humans. 
We have examined the effect of systemic administration of C_D007649 and C_D008012 on brush-evoked (dynamic) D_D010146 and punctate-evoked (static) D_D006930 induced by C_D002211.

C_D016572 and C_D016559-associated D_D057049. 
C_D016572 and C_D016559-associated D_D057049. 
The development of D_D057049 (D_D057049) associated with the use of C_D016572 has been well documented. 
As a result, switching to C_D016559 has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of C_D016572-induced D_D057049. 
As a result, switching to C_D016559 has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of C_D016572-induced D_D057049. 
With the more widespread application of C_D016559 in organ transplantation, C_D016559-associated D_D057049 has also been recognized. 
However, literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of D_D057049 in patients exposed sequentially to C_D016572 and C_D016559 is limited.

We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed C_D016572-induced D_D057049 that responded to the withdrawal of C_D016572 in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy. 
Introduction of C_D016559 as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of D_D057049 and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft. 
Patients who are switched from C_D016572 to C_D016559 or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent D_D057049.

Repeated transient D_D001002 following C_D019808 administration in a patient with a solitary kidney. 
We report the case of a 70-year-old D_D006973 man with a solitary kidney and D_D051436 who developed two episodes of transient D_D001002 after C_D019808 administration. 
Surprisingly, the first dose of 50 mg of C_D019808 resulted in a sudden D_D001002, which lasted eight hours despite high-dose C_D005665 and C_D000588 infusion. 
One week later, by mistake, C_D019808 was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg, the patient developed a second episode of transient D_D001002 lasting 10 hours. 
In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and D_D009336 cell deaths during C_D000082-induced D_D007674, C_D000638-induced D_D008171 and C_D004317-induced D_D066126 by a novel C_C511402.

D_D004409 in a D_D003866 adolescent on C_D015283. 
We report a favorable response to treatment with C_D015283 by a 15-year-old boy with D_D003865 who exhibited D_D004409 during his first 2 weeks of treatment. 
C_D004177 potentiates C_D009020 antinociception but not D_D003248 after chronic treatment. 
This work evaluates the antinociceptive and D_D003248 effects of the combination of 3.2 mg/kg s.c. C_D009020 with 177.8 mg/kg s.c. C_D004177 in acutely and chronically treated (once a day for 12 days) rats. 
In independent groups, C_D009020 inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4% and 38+/-4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the D_D003248 effects. 
The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by C_D009020 regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that C_D004177 did not potentiate C_D009020-induced D_D003248. 
C_D007069 D_D001927 presenting with D_D020820. 
We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative D_D009207 of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of C_D007069 for D_D010954. 
In the patient described, the presence of D_D020820 during infusion of C_D007069, normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative D_D009207 is associated with the use of C_D007069. 
OBJECTIVES: Given its preclinical success for treating D_D019966 and the increased risk of D_D005128 (D_D005128) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure, we explored the effects of sub-chronic low dose C_D020888 on C_D003042-induced increases in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) C_D004298 (C_D004298). 
CONCLUSIONS: Sub-chronic low dose C_D020888 potentiates and extends the inhibition of C_D003042-induced increases in C_D004298, effectively reducing cumulative exposures and the risk for D_D005128S. 
In D_D002543 induction using 0.014-unit collagenase, C_D006493 enhanced the D_D006406 volume 3.4-fold over that seen in control D_D002543 animals and the D_D006470 7.6-fold. 
We compared the effects of C_D004958 in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to C_D008094-C_D010862-induced D_D013226. 
D_D003693 during C_D003024 treatment: incidence and associated risk factors. 
BACKGROUND: Incidence and risk factors for D_D003693 during C_D003024 treatment require further clarification. 
METHODS: We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult D_D001523 inpatients treated with C_D003024 (1995-96), reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of D_D003693, and tested associations with potential risk factors. 
CONCLUSIONS: D_D003693 was found in 10 % of C_D003024-treated inpatients, particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics. 
A 77-y-old patient developed D_D018908, D_D010243, D_D004401 and D_D014202 1 h after ingestion of 200 mg C_D007654 for the first time in his life.

C_D002211 (0.01-1 mm) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced D_D006940 and provoked lacrimation. 
Similar to rats, systemic C_D010862 injection causes D_D013226 (D_D013226) and the eventual development of spontaneous D_D012640 and mossy fiber sprouting in C57BL/6 and CD1 mice, but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice.

In C_D008274(2+)-free bathing medium containing C_D001640, conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices, electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a single population spike in granule cells from control mice and C_D010862-treated mice that did not experience D_D013226. 
The alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic C_D000109 receptor subunits are necessary for C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948 in mice. 
The alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic C_D000109 receptor subunits are necessary for C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948 in mice. 
Binding of C_D009538 to nicotinic C_D000109 receptors (nAChRs) elicits a series of dose-dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration, sedation, and D_D014202, to D_D012640 and D_D003643. 
We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948 in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. 
We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948 in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. 
beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of C_D009538 both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to C_D009538-induced D_D012640. 
alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to C_D009538-induced D_D012640 when compared to wild-type littermates. 
Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and D_D006948.

Recurrent acute D_D009395 induced by C_D017963. 
A 14-year-old girl is reported with recurrent, C_D017963-induced, acute D_D009395. 
C_D014635-induced D_D001927. 
C_D014635-induced D_D001927 is a rare syndrome that may manifest in otherwise normal D_D004827 individuals. 
A case of C_D014635-induced D_D001927 is presented. 
Their D_D006311 is a serious health problem and, as their D_D006311 mechanism involves the production of C_D009569, we need to assess the use of C_D009569 inhibitors for the prevention of C_D000617-induced D_D006319. 
C_D019331 reduced C_D005839-induced D_D034381 in the high-frequency range, but gave no protection in the middle or low frequencies. 
D_D020293 following oral C_D008774 intake in an adult: a case report. 
D_D020293 associated with C_D000661 abuse is well documented, and in rare cases D_D002544 has been reported after C_D008774 intake in children. 
D_D002543 induced by C_D014859 - the influence of drug-drug interactions. 
PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency, severity and preventability of C_D014859-induced D_D002543 due to C_D014859 and C_D014859-drug interactions in patients living in the county of Osterg tland, Sweden. 
Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether C_D014859 and C_D014859-drug interactions could have caused the D_D002543. 
RESULTS: Among 593 patients with D_D002543, 59 (10%) were assessed as related to C_D014859 treatment. 
A C_D014859-drug interaction could have contributed to the D_D006470 in 24 (41%) of the C_D014859 patients and in 7 of these (12%) the D_D006470 complication was considered being possible to avoid. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D014859-induced D_D002543 are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate. 
A significant proportion of C_D014859-related D_D002543 might have been prevented if greater caution had been taken when prescribing drugs known to interact with C_D014859. 
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of C_D008775 and C_D005839 in the posterior sub-Tenon's space was related to a high incidence of side effects including D_D020250, and D_D006261.

In the present study, we investigated whether C_C524754 could improve D_D003072 in C_D012601-injected rats and in C_C544092-infused rats. 
We report 3 cases of serious D_D006470 complications that appear to be the result of the interaction between C_D014859 and C_D064704.

To this end, persistent D_D006930 was induced by administration of C_D002211 in the tail of gonadally intact F344 rats, following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus, and tail-withdrawal latencies measured. 
Development of D_D011507 after switch to C_D020123-based immunosuppression in long-term cardiac transplant patients. 
The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug C_D020123 (C_D020123) lacks D_D007674 effects; however, D_D011507 associated with C_D020123 has been reported following renal transplantation.

In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of D_D011507 associated with C_D020123 is unknown. 
Thus, D_D011507 may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to C_D020123, which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients. 
C_D020123 should be used with C_D000806/C_D057911 therapy and patients monitored for D_D011507 and increased D_D007674.

SAR studies led to compound 14 with excellent potency (K(i) = 0.4 nM), selectivity (A(1)/A(2A) > 100), and efficacy (MED 10 mg/kg p.o.) in the rat C_D006220-induced D_D002375 model for D_D010300. 
9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of C_D015632-induced D_D009422 of C_D004298 neurons. 
Because the D_D009422 caused by C_D008694 and C_D015632 is highly selective for the C_D004298 neuronal system in mouse models of D_D020258, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in C_D008694-induced D_D020258 and microglial activation.

The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15.6 to 2.8 g. Within 14 days of the oral C_D004164 (C_D019386 sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with D_D058186. 
Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 in C_D004317-induced D_D009404. 
C_D004317 treatment resulted in heavy D_D011507 (>100 mg protein/mg crea) in 15/44 of sgk1(+/+) and 15/44 of sgk1(-/-) mice leading to severe D_D009404 with D_D001201, D_D006949, and D_D034141 in both genotypes.

Clinically significant D_D011507 following the administration of C_D020123 to renal transplant recipients. 
BACKGROUND: C_D020123 is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less D_D007674 than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens. 
To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant D_D011507 linked with the use of C_D020123. 
We have encountered several patients who developed substantial D_D011507 associated with C_D020123 use. 
In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of C_D020123 therapy and D_D011507 implicated C_D020123 as the most likely etiology of the D_D011507. 
In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of C_D020123 and the development of D_D009404-range D_D011507. 
D_D011507 correlated most strongly with C_D020123 therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. 
In most patients, discontinuation of C_D020123 resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of D_D011507. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D020123 induces or aggravates pre-existing D_D011507 in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. 
D_D011507 may improve, but does not resolve, when C_D020123 is withdrawn. 
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of morning-dosed C_C048833 on sleep and D_D012893 in chronic C_D003042 users. 
CONCLUSIONS: Morning-dosed C_C048833 promotes nocturnal sleep, normalizes sleep architecture, and decreases D_D012893 in abstinent C_D003042 users. 
D_D001480 reported as AEs occurred in 15% and 18%, 34%, and 10% of the C_C522667 at 5 and 10 mg BID, C_D006220, and placebo groups, respectively.

C_D013974 abuse: an unusual case of D_D013971 in pregnancy. 
In particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with D_D001068 and reminds us that when a cause for D_D013971 remains obscure, C_D013974 abuse should be considered and explored. 
Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in C_D008694-induced D_D009422. 
C_D008070 pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or C_D008694-elicited D_D005334 three days later. 
The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) C_D004656 was assessed in Munich-Wistar rats with established C_D004317 D_D009401. 
Rats were given a single dose of C_D004317 and one month later divided into four groups matched for D_D000419, blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentration. 
Groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of C_D004656 on progression of D_D007674 in C_D004317 D_D009401. 
Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged D_D001049 after C_D013390 for electroconvulsive therapy. 
CONCLUSION: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of C_D013390 had mutations in BCHE, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of D_D001049. 
Mild D_D000860 (SO2<90%) was the most common event (11 patients); 3 patients (2%) presented transient D_D000860 due to upper D_D000402 by probe introduction and 8 (5.8%) due to D_D000860 caused by C_D008874 use. 
The convulsant activity of C_D002045 was not significantly modified but C_D002118 channel blockers decreased the time of latency to obtain C_D002045-induced D_D012640; this effect was less pronounced with C_D015764. 
C_D012642-induced D_D007024 in D_D010300: a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal. 
Recently, we found that therapy with C_D012642 and C_D007980 was associated with selective D_D007024 which was abolished by withdrawal of C_D012642. 
Recently, we found that therapy with C_D012642 and C_D007980 was associated with selective D_D007024 which was abolished by withdrawal of C_D012642. 
The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping C_D012642 in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes D_D007024. 
RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused D_D007024 which was marked in six of 20 D_D010300 patients on C_D012642, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. 
D_D007024 was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of C_D012642 and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. 
Stopping C_D012642 also significantly D_D007024 consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action. 
CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that C_D012642 in combination with C_D007980 is associated with selective D_D007024. 
CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that C_D012642 in combination with C_D007980 is associated with selective D_D007024. 
Explicit episodic memory for sensory-discriminative components of C_D002211-induced D_D010146: immediate and delayed ratings. 
In order to address long-term D_D010146 memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of C_D002211 (0.05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals. 
Subjects were able to reliably discriminate D_D010146 magnitude and duration across C_D002211 doses (both p<0.001), regardless of whether first-time ratings were requested immediately, after one hour or after one day.

C_D011342-induced polymorphous D_D017180. 
Seven cases of C_D011342-induced polymorphous D_D017180 are presented. 
In four patients, polymorphous D_D017180 appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of C_D011342 for the treatment of sustained D_D017180. 
In the seventh patient, a permanent ventricular pacemaker was inserted and, despite continuation of C_D011342 therapy, polymorphous D_D017180 did not reoccur. 
These seven cases demonstrate that C_D011342 can produce an acquired D_D008133 with polymorphous D_D017180. 
Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent-labeled C_D003911 before and during C_D010656-induced acute D_D006973 in rats treated with vehicle and C_C065679 (0.1 microM). 
C_D001374 potentiates D_D011230 in rat liver. 
To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the D_D011230, C_D001374 (C_D001374) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, C_D001564 (200 mg/kg), C_D008770 (60 mg/kg) and C_D019813 (C_D019813) (100 mg/kg).

Compared with sham-operated controls, lesions significantly (p < 0.25) blunted the early (<60 min) free-field D_D009069 caused by C_D009538 (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.m.), enhanced the later (60-120 min) C_D009538-induced D_D006948, and raised spontaneous nocturnal activity. 
Assessment of a new non-invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of C_D004280-induced D_D017202. 
BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting C_D004280-induced D_D017202. 
OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting C_D004280-induced D_D017202, using C_D017256 single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of D_D007511. 
D_D017114 in two patients with regular C_D000431 consumption ingesting C_D000082 at therapeutic dosage. 
BACKGROUND: The possible role of C_D000431 in the development of D_D056486 associated with therapeutic doses of C_D000082 (C_D000082) is currently debated. 
CASE REPORT: We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of C_D000431 and who developed D_D017093 within 3-5 days after hospitalization and stopping C_D000431 consumption while being treated with 4 g C_D000082/day. 
Possible risk factors for the development of D_D056486 in patients treated with therapeutic doses of C_D000082 are discussed. 
C_D003042 related D_D002637: are we seeing the tip of an iceberg? 
In particular, the tendency of C_D003042 to produce D_D002637 ought to be in the mind of the emergency nurse when faced with a young victim of D_D002637 who is otherwise at low risk. 
The mechanism of D_D002637 related to C_D003042 use is discussed and treatment dilemmas are discussed.

D_D019965 was observed in a 29-year-old female in the prognostic period after the onset of C_C017367-induced D_D056784. 
Consequently, C_C017367-induced D_D056784 may uncommonly result in D_D010554 in the residual state. 
Previously recognized side effects, particularly D_D014202 and D_D012817, were more frequent in the C_D008801 group than in the placebo group.

Regional localization of the antagonism of C_D000661-induced D_D006948 by intracerebral C_D002116 injections. 
Fatal D_D013345 associated with prehospital use of C_D004837. 
C_D004837 has a proven role in D_D006323 in prehospital care; however, use by paramedics in patients with suspected D_D004342 and severe D_D006973 should be viewed with caution.

Preclinical toxicologic investigation suggested that a new C_D002118 channel blocker, C_D020748, induced D_D018376 in rat fetuses exposed to this agent during organogenesis. 
A low incidence of D_D018376 was observed after exposure to each of the four C_D002118 channel blockers, but this incidence was statistically significant only for C_D014700 and C_D009543.

The effects of C_C009250 on C_D008012-induced D_D012640. 
The influence of C_C009250 on C_D008012-induced D_D012640 was studied in cats. 
It is suggested that C_C009250 reduces the D_D012640 effect of C_D008012 D_D064420 but carries some risk due to circulatory D_D003866. 
Anti-oxidant effects of C_C065179 in C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in the rat. 
C_D003907 (C_D003907)-induced D_D006973 is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with C_D009569 (C_D009569) deficiency and increased C_D013481 (C_D013481) production.

C_C065179 (C_C065179) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of C_D009569 and reduced C_D013481 production in various forms of D_D006973. 
C_C067171 for detection of C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats. 
C_C067171 was easy to prepare, stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with C_D007545-induced acute D_D009203. 
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for C_D006220 in doses of 2-3 mg/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe D_D001480. 
After 1 week of recovery, D_D011507 was induced by C_D004317 [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. 
RESULTS: As anticipated, C_D004317 elicited D_D009404 range D_D011507, D_D007674 and mild D_D005923.

Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in D_D011507 after C_D004317 (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). 
In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of C_D005839 sulfate or C_D014031 sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of C_D000617-related D_D051437, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function. 
In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of C_D005839 sulfate or C_D014031 sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of C_D000617-related D_D051437, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function. 
Five of 33 (15%) of the C_D014031-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the C_D005839-treated patients had D_D051437. 
Five of 33 (15%) of the C_D014031-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the C_D005839-treated patients had D_D051437. 
Thus, C_D005839 was associated with D_D051437 more than three times as often as was C_D014031.

Neuroprotective action of C_C121465, a selective mGluR5 antagonist, in C_D008694-induced C_D004298rgic D_D020258 is associated with a decrease in C_D004298 outflow and inhibition of D_D005334 in rats. 
Moreover, it transiently diminished the C_D008694 (10 mg/kg sc)-induced D_D005334 and reduced basal body temperature. 
Neuroprotection rendered by C_C121465 may be associated with the reduction of the C_D008694-induced C_D004298 efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5, and with a decrease in D_D005334. 
Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with C_D003891 alone than when receiving C_D003891 with C_C476217 (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (D_D009325 and D_D006261) have been reported for patients treated with either C_D003891 or C_C476217.

Proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of C_D007980-induced D_D004409. 
C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D004409) is among the motor complications that arise in D_D010300 (D_D010300) patients after a prolonged treatment with C_D007980. 
Rats treated with C_D007980 were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of D_D004409. 
C_D014635 induced D_D001927--19 new cases in Germany from 1994 to 2003--a side effect associated to C_D014635-therapy not only in young children. 
Rare serious complications may occur in some patients, including haemorrhagic D_D010195, D_D001855, C_D014635-induced D_D056486 and C_D014635-induced D_D001927.

There is still no proof of causative effect of C_D014635 in patients with D_D001927, but only of an association with an assumed causal relation. 
We report 19 patients with C_D014635-associated D_D001927 in Germany from the years 1994 to 2003, none of whom had been published previously. 
D_D006463 after treatment with C_D008795. 
This paper describes the clinical features of six children who developed the D_D006463 after treatment with C_D008795. 
While the involvement of C_D008795 in the aetiology of the D_D006463 is not established firmly, the action of this drug in sensitizing tissues to oxidation injury and the reported evidence of oxidation changes in the D_D006463 suggest a possible link between C_D008795 treatment and some cases of the D_D006463. 
Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in patients with C_D002927-associated mental D_D003221. 
15 cases of C_D002927-associated mental D_D003221 have been reported. 
Subjects with D_D006319 were submitted to C_D003676 reduction or temporary withdrawal. 
Since the introduction of C_D000806 into the adjunctive treatment of patients with D_D006333, cases of severe D_D007022, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. 
To assess the safety of the C_D000806 C_D004656 a multicenter, randomized, C_D011224-controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic D_D007022 on the first day of treatment. 
To assess the safety of the C_D000806 C_D004656 a multicenter, randomized, C_D011224-controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic D_D007022 on the first day of treatment. 
Patients who received C_D004656 experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic D_D007022 (5.2%) than the patients who received C_D011224 (12.9%). 
Antagonism between interleukin 3 and erythropoietin in mice with C_D015215-induced D_D000740 and in bone marrow endothelial cells. 
C_D015215 (C_D015215)-induced D_D000740 in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF-IL-3 (fusion protein of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) and interleukin 3). 
Dose-dependent D_D001919 induced by C_D014700 was potentiated by LC_D012964, LC_D002118, and HC_D002118. 
C_D012964 status influences chronic C_D000666 D_D007674 in rats. 
The D_D007674 potential of C_D000666 (5 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks) has been investigated in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats. 
Reversible D_D001927 in C_D008795-induced D_D001927: magnetic resonance findings on diffusion-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging. 
OBJECTIVE: This is to present reversible D_D001927s in C_D008795-induced D_D001927, to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having C_D008795-induced D_D001927 (age range; 43-78 years). 
CONCLUSIONS: Reversible D_D001927s could be considered as the characteristic for C_D008795-induced D_D001927, next to the dentate nucleus involvement. 
There was also a higher incidence of D_D013610 (P less than 0.05) and D_D018879 (P less than 0.05) in the C_D009020 infusion group. 
Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in D_D004827 patients after C_D010672 D_D062787. 
We conclude that C_D010672 D_D062787 does not necessarily result in D_D002526 and it is unlikely that C_D010672 medication was the only cause of D_D002526 in the remaining patients. 
Evaluation of cardiac troponin I and T levels as markers of D_D009202 in C_D004317-induced D_D009202 rats, and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings. 
We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of D_D009202 in a rat model of C_D004317 (C_D004317)-induced D_D009202, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of D_D006331 monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. 
We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of D_D009202 in a rat model of C_D004317 (C_D004317)-induced D_D009202, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of D_D006331 monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. 
CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of D_D017202 after C_D004317 in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect D_D009202 assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. 
The reduction of C_D016572- or C_D016559 trough levels and the administration of C_D002118 channel blockers led to relief of D_D010146.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of C_D004809 to C_D015742 in order to obtund the D_D007022 response. 
The addition of C_D004809 to C_D015742 appears to be an effective method of obtunding the D_D007022 response to C_D015742 at all doses used in this study. 
However, marked D_D013610 associated with the use of C_D004809 in combination with C_D015742 occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients. 
However, marked D_D013610 associated with the use of C_D004809 in combination with C_D015742 occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients. 
Due to the risk of this D_D013610 inducing D_D017202, we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the C_D004809/C_D015742/mixtures studied. 
In six of the probable cases the D_D009422 consisted of an acute reversible D_D001927 usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of C_D007464 over a short period. 
We wanted to study whether C_D014148 retains its D_D012640 action if incorporated into a FS. 
FINDINGS: FS containing C_D014148 caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct D_D012640 behaviours. 
The degree of these D_D012640 increased with increasing concentration of C_D014148. 
Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml C_D014148 evoked generalized D_D012640 in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of C_D014148 (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated D_D012640 potentials in 1 of 6 rats. 
INTERPRETATION: C_D014148 retains its D_D012640 action within FS. 
A diet promoting D_D019966 causes D_D006948 to a low dose of C_D000661. 
The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show D_D006948 to a low dose of C_D000661. 
The animals that had experienced cyclic C_D013395 and chow were D_D006948 in response to C_D000661 compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% C_D013395 and chow followed by C_D000661 injection, cyclic chow followed by C_D000661 injection, ad libitum chow with C_D000661, or cyclic 10% C_D013395 and chow with a saline injection). 
The animals that had experienced cyclic C_D013395 and chow were D_D006948 in response to C_D000661 compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% C_D013395 and chow followed by C_D000661 injection, cyclic chow followed by C_D000661 injection, ad libitum chow with C_D000661, or cyclic 10% C_D013395 and chow with a saline injection). 
C_D010396-induced D_D001018 in rats. 
On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without D_D006333 given C_D003630, even at more than 700 mg/m(2).

Patterns of D_D056486 induced by C_D008750. 
The remaining patient in the series developed D_D017114 when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of C_D008750-induced D_D056486. 
In this latter patient, and in 2 others, the causal relationship between C_D008750 and D_D008107 was proved with the recurrence of D_D056486 within 2 weeks of re-exposure to the drug. 
C_D001556 (C_D001556), the active ingredient of the insecticide C_D001556, has been shown to decrease D_D012640 threshold to pentylenetrazol (C_D010433) 3 h after exposure to C_D001556 and conversely increase threshold to C_D010433-induced D_D012640 24 h after exposure to C_D001556 (Vohland et al. 1981). 
D_D012640 activity due to C_D010433 and C_D010852 (C_D010852) was significantly decreased; however, D_D012640 activity due to C_D015097 (C_D015097), C_D001640 (C_D001640), C_C034818 (C_C034818), or C_D013331 (C_D013331) was not different from control.

Protective efficacy of neuroactive C_D013256 against C_D003042 kindled-D_D012640 in mice. 
The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive C_D013256 that positively modulate the C_D005680 (C_D005680(A)) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of C_D003042 engendered by repeated C_D003042 administration (D_D012640 kindling). 
C_D011280 (C_D011280), C_D011280 (C_D011280) and C_C105051 (a synthetic derivative of alloC_D011280 C_C105051) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression (anticonvulsant effect) and development (antiepileptogenic effect) of C_D003042-kindled D_D012640 in male, Swiss-Webster mice. 
Kindled D_D012640 were induced by daily administration of 60 mg/kg C_D003042 for 5 days. 
These are D_D007674, but C_D020123 seems to act differently displaying only minor D_D007674 effects, although this question is still open. 
In a number of treatment protocols where C_D020123 was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic D_D007674 effect were described. 
CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic D_D007674 effect of C_D016572 plus C_D020123, whereas C_D016559 plus C_D020123 was better tolerated. 
CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic D_D007674 effect of C_D016572 plus C_D020123, whereas C_D016559 plus C_D020123 was better tolerated. 
CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic D_D007674 effect of C_D016572 plus C_D020123, whereas C_D016559 plus C_D020123 was better tolerated. 
C_C007789-treated rats exhibited evidence of D_D020141 and D_D020141, had larger D_D006406s, and tended to have less D_D007249 in the vicinity of the D_D006406 after three days. 
C_D000082-associated D_D003128, D_D000138, renal and hepatic failure. 
A case of D_D000138, acute renal failure and hepatic failure following C_D000082 ingestion is presented. 
In two of the three D_D003643 probably associated with C_D007654 treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of D_D007565 and other symptoms of D_D056486. 
In two of the three D_D003643 probably associated with C_D007654 treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of D_D007565 and other symptoms of D_D056486. 
Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of D_D056486 is advised during long term treatment with C_D007654 to prevent possible serious D_D056486. 
Combined effects of prolonged C_D000527-induced D_D007022 and D_D020141 on human hepatic function. 
Combined effects of prolonged C_D000527 (C_D000527)-induced D_D007022 and D_D020141 on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery. 
Controlled D_D007022 in groups A and C was induced with C_D000527 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min. 
The results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of C_D000527-induced D_D007022 and moderate D_D020141 would cause D_D008107.

C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in patients with D_D010300: filling the bench-to-bedside gap. 
Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying C_D007980-induced D_D004409, their pathogenesis is still unclear. 
Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms, C_D004298 receptor subtypes, ionotropic and metabotropic C_D018698 receptors, and non-C_D004298rgic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of C_D007980-induced D_D004409. 
In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) in a model of D_D004827 induced by C_D010862 in rats. 
Cardioprotective effect of C_C066201 on C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats. 
The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of C_C066201 on C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats. 
The results of our study suggest that C_C066201 possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against C_D007545-induced D_D009203. 
Acute effects of C_C108761 on hippocampal C_D000596 neurotransmitters in C_D010862-induced D_D012640 in rats. 
C_C108761 was more potent than C_D014635, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against C_D010862-induced D_D012640 whereas the corresponding value for C_D014635 was 322 mg/kg. 
Based on the finding that C_C108761 and C_D014635 could protect the animals against C_D010862-induced D_D012640 it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory C_D000596 neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of C_D018698 and C_D001224. 
Therefore, like C_D014635, the finding that C_C108761 could drastically reduce C_D010862-induced increases in C_D018698 and C_D001224 should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in C_D010862-induced D_D012640 in experimental animals. 
Acute D_D056486 attack after exposure to C_C106791. 
The patient had suffered a previous episode of "acute D_D056486 of unknown origin," that occurred after C_C106791 usage. 
Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo D_D064420 probability scale, C_C106791 was the probable cause of acute D_D056486 in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced toxic D_D056486. 
Recurrence of D_D056486 attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed C_C106791 the second time. 
CONCLUSION: Here we report a case of acute D_D056486 probably associated with the administration of C_C106791. 
C_D013148-induced D_D051437 and D_D006947 in patients with D_D006333. 
C_D013148-induced D_D051437 and D_D006947 in patients with D_D006333. 
BACC_D011188GROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of C_D013148 in D_D006333 patients reported a low risk of D_D006947 (2%) and D_D051437 (0%).

BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors C_D016572 and C_D016559 are both known to be D_D007674. 
BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors C_D016572 and C_D016559 are both known to be D_D007674. 
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous C_D009553 West European D_D020521 Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between C_D009553-induced D_D007022 (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in D_D020521. 
C_D009553 treatment resulted in a statistically significant D_D007022 (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. 
D_D009422 after spinal anesthesia: a lower incidence with C_D011318 and C_D002045 than with C_D008012. 
D_D009422 after spinal anesthesia: a lower incidence with C_D011318 and C_D002045 than with C_D008012. 
BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that D_D009422 (D_D009422) frequently follow C_D008012 spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with C_D002045. 
Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares C_D011318 with C_D008012 and C_D002045 with respect to duration of action and relative risk of D_D009422. 
Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares C_D011318 with C_D008012 and C_D002045 with respect to duration of action and relative risk of D_D009422. 
RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving C_D008012 experienced D_D009422, 1 of 30 patients receiving C_D011318 (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving C_D002045 had D_D009422. 
RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving C_D008012 experienced D_D009422, 1 of 30 patients receiving C_D011318 (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving C_D002045 had D_D009422. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D011318 may be preferable to C_D008012 for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of D_D009422.

The role of C_D009538 in smoking-related D_D002318. 
C_D009538 activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to D_D002318. 
Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that C_D009538 could play a role in accelerating D_D050197, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect. 
D_D012640 resulting from a C_C047426 D_D062787. 
D_D012640 resulting from a C_C047426 D_D062787. 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of C_C047426 D_D062787. 
CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old woman with D_D003865 took an D_D062787 of C_C047426 in an apparent suicide attempt. 
After the ingestion of 26 C_C047426 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized D_D012640. 
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of C_C047426 D_D062787 that resulted in a generalized D_D012640. 
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of C_C047426 D_D062787 that resulted in a generalized D_D012640. 
Based on nonD_D062787 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of C_C047426 and the potential risks of available interventions, no emergent therapy was instituted. 
CONCLUSIONS: The C_C047426 D_D062787 in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized D_D012640 but elicited no further sequelae. 
CONCLUSIONS: The C_C047426 D_D062787 in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized D_D012640 but elicited no further sequelae. 
Two groups of patients receiving C_D016559 were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising D_D006973 patients who were receiving C_D009543, and the other comprising nonD_D006973 patients not receiving C_D009543. 
The observed positive impact of C_D009543 on reducing the D_D007674 associated with C_D016559 in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat D_D006973 in this population.

D_D054138 associated with continuous-infusion C_D002927. 
The administration of intermittent intravenous infusions of C_D002927 is infrequently associated with the development of D_D001919. 
A 40-year-old man with D_D007938 and no history of D_D006331 developed recurrent, brief episodes of apparent D_D054138 while receiving continuous-infusion C_D002927 50 mg/hour. 
This is the first reported case of D_D054138 associated with continuous-infusion C_D002927. 
Composition of D_D042882 associated with C_D015282: response to oral C_D014580. 
C_D015282, an effective treatment for D_D000172, induces D_D042882 in 13-60% of patients. 
Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 C_D015282 treated D_D000172 patients with D_D042882. 
In conclusion, C_D015282 induced D_D042882 are generally small, multiple, and C_D002784 rich although, in common with spontaneous D_D042882 disease, at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some D_D042882 containing C_D002118. 
D_D002318 associated with C_D013726 treatment for D_D007752. 
Severe D_D002318 occurred in eight of 160 patients treated with C_D013726 for D_D007752. 
Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of C_C004616 seven (35%) developed hind-limb D_D010243. 
Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received C_C004616, 13 showed D_D013118; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal. 
D_D006947 associated with C_D013467 therapy. 
D_D006947 has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAID) such as C_D007213. 
We describe 4 patients in whom D_D006947 ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mEq/l developed within 3 to 8 days of C_D013467 administration. 
As no other medications known to effect serum C_D011188 had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause-and-effect relationship between C_D013467 and D_D006947. 
D_D014693 during cesarean section after C_D012312 therapy: interaction with anesthetics. 
Immunohistochemical, electron microscopic and morphometric studies of C_D004967-induced rat D_D015175 after C_D001971 treatment. 
To clarify the effects of C_D001971 on D_D015175 cells in vivo, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to C_D004967-induced rat D_D015175 cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of C_D001971 (3 mg/kg of body weight). 
D_D006529 and D_D009133 occurred in Wistar rats following the subcutaneous administration of C_D011239.

Possible intramuscular C_D008874-associated D_D006323 and D_D003643. 
This report describes the first published case of D_D006323 and D_D003643 associated with intramuscular administration of C_D008874. 
Serial D_D004827 caused by C_C009265 administration in two patients on hemodialysis. 
Effect of C_D005997 on D_D000647 caused by C_D012601. 
The present study was carried out to test the effects of C_D005997 (C_D005997) on D_D008569 induced by C_D012601 in man. 
The findings of this study indicate that the drug is able to antagonize D_D008569 induced by C_D012601. 
D_D012640 induced by the C_D003042 metabolite C_C005618 in rats. 
D_D012640 induced by the C_D003042 metabolite C_C005618 in rats. 
The half-life (t1/2) of C_D003042 is relatively short, but some of the consequences of its use, such as D_D012640 and D_D020521, can occur hours after exposure. 
We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of C_D003042, C_C005618 (C_C005618), to cause D_D012640. 
We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of C_D003042, C_C005618 (C_C005618), to cause D_D012640. 
C_C005618-Induced D_D012640 occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of C_D003042. 
C_C005618-Induced D_D012640 occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of C_D003042. 
Whereas C_D003042-induced D_D012640 were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in D_D003643, those induced by C_C005618 were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in D_D003643. 
Whereas C_D003042-induced D_D012640 were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in D_D003643, those induced by C_C005618 were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in D_D003643. 
C_C005618-Injected rats that did not have D_D012640 had significantly more locomotor activity than C_D003042-injected animals without D_D012640. 
C_C005618-Injected rats that did not have D_D012640 had significantly more locomotor activity than C_D003042-injected animals without D_D012640. 
The finding that C_D003042- and C_C005618-induced D_D012640 differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for C_D003042-induced D_D012640 and emphasizes the importance of a C_D003042 metabolite, C_C005618. 
The finding that C_D003042- and C_C005618-induced D_D012640 differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for C_D003042-induced D_D012640 and emphasizes the importance of a C_D003042 metabolite, C_C005618. 
Protection against C_D000661-induced D_D020258 toward striatal C_D004298 neurons in rodents by C_C070935, an excitatory C_D000596 antagonist. 
The data strengthen the evidence that the D_D020258 effect of C_D000661 and related compounds toward nigrostriatal C_D004298 neurons involves C_D016202 receptors and that C_C070935 is an C_D016202 receptor antagonist with long-lasting in vivo effects in rats. 
Neonatal C_D011736 responsive D_D012640 due to C_D007538 therapy. 
A 17-day-old infant on C_D007538 therapy 13 mg/kg daily from birth because of maternal D_D014376 was admitted after 4 days of D_D012640. 
The D_D012640 ceased within 4 hours of administering intramuscular C_D011736, suggesting an aetiology of C_D011736 deficiency secondary to C_D007538 medication. 
C_D005996 has been shown to reduce ST-segment elevation during D_D009203, an effect potentiated in the dog by agents that reverse C_D005996-induced D_D007022. 
Elevation of ADAM10, ADAM17, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression with media degeneration features C_D002122-induced D_D017545 in a rat model. 
PURPOSE: This study was designed to establish a rat model of D_D017545 (D_D017545) by C_D002122 (C_D002122)-induced D_D014652 and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in D_D017545 formation. 
CONCLUSION: This study establishes a D_D017545 model by periarterial C_D002122 exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling. 
However, a bolus of C_D004837 injected through an alternative catheter provoked a D_D006973 crisis. 
Long-term C_D018698 supplementation failed to protect against D_D010523 of C_D017239. 
Toxic D_D010523 is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with C_D017239 (C_D017239), although C_D018698 and its closely related C_D000596 C_D018698 were claimed to ameliorate C_D017239 D_D020258. 
This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of C_D018698 supplementation for preventing C_D017239-induced D_D010523 in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical and electro-diagnostic study. 
This pilot study leads to the conclusion that C_D018698 supplementation at the chosen regimen fails to protect against D_D010523 of C_D017239. 
Attentional modulation of perceived D_D010146 intensity in C_D002211-induced secondary D_D006930. 
Attentional modulation of perceived D_D010146 intensity in C_D002211-induced secondary D_D006930. 
However, it is not known that how D_D010146 intensity ratings are affected by attention in C_D002211-induced secondary D_D006930. 
However, it is not known that how D_D010146 intensity ratings are affected by attention in C_D002211-induced secondary D_D006930. 
Furthermore, it was found that the magnitude of attentional modulation in secondary D_D006930 is very similar to that of C_D002211-untreated, control condition. 
Our findings, showing no interaction between C_D002211 treatment and attentional modulation suggest that C_D002211-induced secondary D_D006930 and attention might affect mechanical D_D010146 through independent mechanisms. 
Our findings, showing no interaction between C_D002211 treatment and attentional modulation suggest that C_D002211-induced secondary D_D006930 and attention might affect mechanical D_D010146 through independent mechanisms. 
No changes in C_D006220-induced D_D002375 or C_D016291-induced locomotion were seen following PD. 
Whether D_D011507 was due to C_D020123 or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range D_D011507 has been observed during C_D020123 therapy in islet transplantation and in patients who received C_D020123 de novo. 
Chronic D_D006966 induced by the C_D004298 antagonist C_D013469 caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of C_D004958. 
We have previously demonstrated that C_D019438 treatment increases D_D050197 formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice. 
A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after C_D010862-induced D_D012640s in wild-type Wistar rats. 
QTLs for susceptibility to C_D010862-induced D_D012640s, a model of D_D004833, have not been reported, and CSS have not previously been used to localize D_D012640 susceptibility genes. 
QTLs for susceptibility to C_D010862-induced D_D012640s, a model of D_D004833, have not been reported, and CSS have not previously been used to localize D_D012640 susceptibility genes. 
We report QTLs identified using a B6 (host) x A/J (donor) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to C_D010862-induced D_D012640s. 
Three hundred fifty-five adult male CSS mice, 58 B6, and 39 A/J were tested for susceptibility to C_D010862-induced D_D012640s. 
Investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of D_D004827 induced by C_D010862. 
In this study, we investigated whether increased generation of FR during D_D013226 would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), complex IV of the respiratory chain, in the chronic phase of the C_D010862 model of temporal lobe D_D004827.

We found that the most-frequent cause of D_D057049 was drug related, secondary mainly to C_D016572. 
A 35-year-old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of C_D004837 developed D_D017682 that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise, profound, albeit transient, D_D018487, and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of D_D009202. 
A 35-year-old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of C_D004837 developed D_D017682 that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise, profound, albeit transient, D_D018487, and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of D_D009202. 
D_D001749 in D_D014890: risks and relation to C_D003520. 
OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of D_D001749, and its relation to C_D003520, in patients with D_D014890. 
Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between C_D003520 and D_D001749 using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. 
The risk of D_D001749 doubled for every 10 g increment in C_D003520 (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). 
CONCLUSION: The results indicate a dose-response relationship between C_D003520 and the risk of D_D001749, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before D_D014890. 
C_D015282-induced D_D000860 and D_D006976 in premature neonates. 
D_D006976 developed after administration of a somatostatin analogue, C_D015282, to enhance resolution of the D_D005402. 
Acute C_D003042-induced D_D012640: differential sensitivity of six inbred mouse strains. 
Mature male and female mice from six inbred stains were tested for susceptibility to behavioral D_D012640 induced by a single injection of C_D003042. 
Additional studies of these murine strains may be useful for investigating genetic influences on C_D003042-induced D_D012640. 
D_D000743 complicating C_D016559 (C_D016559) therapy. 
We describe 3 episodes of D_D000743 (D_D000743) in 2 solid organ recipients under C_D016559 (C_D016559) therapy. 
In both cases, discontinuation of C_D016559 and treatment with plasma exchange, fresh frozen plasma replacement, C_D000305, C_D001241, and C_D004176 led to resolution of D_D000743. 
In one patient, reintroduction of C_D016559 led to rapid recurrence of D_D000743. 
C_D016559-associated D_D000743 is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication. 
In our experience and according to the literature, C_D016559 does not seem to cross-react with C_D016572 (C_D016572), an immuno-suppressive drug already known to induce D_D000743. 
Variant D_D017180 in C_D003891 D_D064420. 
We report a case of variant D_D017180 induced by C_D003891 D_D064420. 
C_D003891-induced D_D003693 at "subtherapeutic" concentrations: a case report. 
An elderly patient treated with low dose C_D003891 developed a D_D003693 while her plasma level was in the "subtherapeutic" range. 
Readministration of C_D000547, after a drug-free overnight period, increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB/C mice where D_D011596 occurred. 
The biochemical results of brain biogenic C_D000588 of BALB/C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of C_D002395 turnover rate and/or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in O-methylation of C_D009638 which may account for a D_D011596 caused by C_D000547 in the BALB/C mice. 
No hepatic preneoplastic nodules or D_D006528 developed in rats fed the plain C_D002794-supplemented diet, while one preneoplastic nodule and one D_D006528 developed in two rats fed the same diet containing C_D010634. 
The incidence of preneoplastic nodules and of D_D006528 was 10% and 37%, respectively, in rats fed the plain C_D002794-devoid diet, and 17% and 30%, in rats fed the C_D010634-containing C_D002794-devoid diet. 
C_D004317 is an effective antiD_D009369 chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic D_D009202. 
To develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for D_D006331 due to C_D004317, a cohort study was performed using C_D004280 infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long-term survivors of childhood D_D009369 treated with C_D004317 from healthy control subjects. 
Effects of C_D000628 on the threshold for initiating D_D014693 during D_D012131. 
The effects of C_D000628 on the D_D014693 threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during D_D012131 were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs. 
During the infusion of C_D000628, the D_D014693 threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of C_D010100 (C_C093415) and C_D002245 (C_D002245) were kept within normal limits. 
When D_D012131 was produced by D_D007040 (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of C_D000628 resulted in an even greater decrease in D_D014693 threshold to 60 percent of the control level. 
C_C093622 was also superior to C_D004878/C_D002110 in the proportions of patients with no D_D009325, D_D014839, D_D012001 or D_D020795 and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake (p < or = 0.001). 
The most common adverse events (incidence > or = 5% in one group) after C_C093622 and C_D004878/C_D002110, respectively, were D_D004244 (6.7 and 5.3%), D_D009325 (4.2 and 8.5%) and D_D006970 (5.5 and 2.3%). 
The most common adverse events (incidence > or = 5% in one group) after C_C093622 and C_D004878/C_D002110, respectively, were D_D004244 (6.7 and 5.3%), D_D009325 (4.2 and 8.5%) and D_D006970 (5.5 and 2.3%). 
Five patients with D_D002277 developed D_D057049 (characterized by D_D051437, D_D000743, and usually D_D013921) after treatment with C_D002945, C_D001761, and a C_D014748. 
Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined, because D_D051437 may be ascribed to C_D002945 D_D007674 and the D_D000740 and D_D013921 to drug-induced D_D001855.

The most common side effects attributable to the C_C104457 included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor D_D009422 and D_D059352. 
The most common side effects attributable to the C_C104457 included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor D_D009422 and D_D059352. 
D_D006402 was greater for the combination than C_C104457 alone, although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies. 
Our experience supports the safety of giving C_C104457 as salvage therapy in synchrony with C_D005047 and C_D003520, although D_D009422 must be closely monitored. 
A 34-year-old lady developed a constellation of D_D003872, D_D005334, D_D008206 and D_D056486, beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral C_D012460 for sero-negative D_D001172.

C_D001920 receptors antagonists and C_D009569 synthase inhibitors in C_D014750 and C_D013311 induced D_D006930 in chemotherapy and D_D003929 rat model. 
C_D001920 receptors antagonists and C_D009569 synthase inhibitors in C_D014750 and C_D013311 induced D_D006930 in chemotherapy and D_D003929 rat model. 
C_D001920 receptors antagonists and C_D009569 synthase inhibitors in C_D014750 and C_D013311 induced D_D006930 in chemotherapy and D_D003929 rat model. 
It was also shown that both products of inducible C_D009569 synthase and neuronal C_D009569 synthase activation as well as C_D001920 are involved in D_D006930 produced by C_D014750. 
In C_D013311-induced D_D006930, inducible C_D009569 synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of C_D001920, whereas in C_D014750-induced D_D006930 C_D001920 seemed to activate neuronal C_D009569 synthase pathway.

Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic D_D001943 receiving 96-h infusional C_D003520 as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant D_D006333 (D_D006333) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, D_D006973, prior cardiac history, smoking, D_D003920, prior use of C_D018943, and left-sided chest irradiation. 
RESULTS: Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 D_D006333 following infusional C_D003520 with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. 
Routine EKG monitoring during infusional C_D003520 did not predict D_D006333 development. 
Inappropriate use of C_D002220 and C_D020888 in typical D_D004832. 
Inappropriate use of C_D002220 and C_D020888 in typical D_D004832. 
C_D002220 and C_D020888 are contraindicated in typical D_D004832. 
C_D002220 and C_D020888 are contraindicated in typical D_D004832. 
Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with C_D002220 and two of these developed D_D009207, which resolved on withdrawal of C_D002220. 
D_D000743 associated with the use of C_D009853. 
We report the first case of a serious short-term adverse reaction with the use of C_D009853: D_D000743. 
The patient developed weakness, D_D053609, and D_D004417 2 days after starting therapy with C_D009853. 
The patient developed weakness, D_D053609, and D_D004417 2 days after starting therapy with C_D009853. 
The mechanism by which C_D009853 caused the patient's D_D000743 is uncertain, but physicians should be alerted to this possible adverse effect. 
Seven patients developed D_D018149 characteristic of D_D003920 but these were mild, did not require treatment and returned to normal on ceasing C_D016049. 
BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently C_D012254 has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as C_C473478 and C_C471405 have been found to cause acute D_D006461.

CONCLUSION: This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and C_D012254 induced D_D000740 in patients with D_D019698 and we could not find any relation. 
(+/-)-C_C087567 (10-40 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to prevent D_D000647 induced by C_D012601 (1 mg kg-1 i.p.) and C_D004025 (2 mg kg-1 i.p.) in the mouse passive-avoidance test.

The results have shown that the degradation product C_C004658 is not a significant factor in C_C010882 associated erosive D_D003556. 
A high percentage of C_D007612-C_D003091 and C_D011206 irrigations were associated with erosive D_D003556 and suggested a possible complication with human usage.

C_D003474 ameliorates D_D003072 and oxidative damage in C_D010634 and C_D002220 administered rats. 
The antiepileptic drugs, C_D010634 and C_D002220 are well known to cause D_D003072 on chronic use. 
The antiepileptic drugs, C_D010634 and C_D002220 are well known to cause D_D003072 on chronic use. 
Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic C_D003474 administration on C_D010634- and C_D002220-induced D_D003072 and oxidative stress in rats. 
Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic C_D003474 administration on C_D010634- and C_D002220-induced D_D003072 and oxidative stress in rats. 
The administration of C_D010634 and C_D002220 for 21days caused a significant D_D003072 as well as an increased oxidative stress. 
The administration of C_D010634 and C_D002220 for 21days caused a significant D_D003072 as well as an increased oxidative stress. 
These results show that C_D003474 has beneficial effect in mitigating the D_D003072 and oxidative damage in rats treated with C_D010634 and C_D002220 without significantly altering their serum concentrations.

C_C020972 protects the piriform cortex in the C_D010862 D_D013226 model. 
The effect of C_C020972 on D_D013226-associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated C_D010862 model. 
Development of C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in D_D010300 monkeys may depend upon rate of symptom onset and/or duration of symptoms. 
C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D004409) present a major problem for the long-term management of D_D010300 (D_D010300) patients. 
Using macaque monkeys with different types of C_D015632-induced D_D010302, the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of C_D007980 therapy may be involved in the development of D_D004409. 
Using macaque monkeys with different types of C_D015632-induced D_D010302, the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of C_D007980 therapy may be involved in the development of D_D004409. 
Monkeys with acute (short-term) C_D015632 exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of C_D007980 therapy developed D_D004409 between 11 and 24 days of daily C_D007980 administration. 
In contrast, monkeys with long-term C_D015632 exposure, slow symptom progression and/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of C_D007980 therapy were more resistant to developing D_D004409 (e.g., D_D004409 developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic C_D007980 administration). 
These data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop D_D004409 in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to C_D007980 and demonstrate the value of these models for further studying the pathophysiology of D_D004409. 
C_D011441-induced perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-positive D_D014657 in conjunction with D_D010493. 
OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of C_D011441-induced D_D014657 manifesting with D_D010493. 
METHODS: We present the first case report of a woman with D_D006980 treated with C_D011441 in whom a syndrome of D_D010493, D_D005334, and D_D005921 developed.

METHODS: We present the first case report of a woman with D_D006980 treated with C_D011441 in whom a syndrome of D_D010493, D_D005334, and D_D005921 developed. 
A literature review revealed no prior reports of D_D010493 in anti-MPO pANCA-positive D_D014657 associated with C_D011441 therapy. 
CONCLUSION: D_D010493 may be the initial manifestation of drug-induced D_D014657 attributable to C_D011441 therapy. 
Two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to C_C036150-induced D_D012640 are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other C_D005680(A) receptor ligands. 
Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity (BS line) or resistance (BR line) to D_D012640 induced by a single i.p. injection of methyl C_C036150-3-carboxylate (C_C036150), an inverse agonist of the C_D005680(A) receptor C_D001569 site. 
We measured C_D003975-induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus-maze test, C_D003975-induced sedation by recording the vigilance states, and C_D010852- and C_D010433-induced D_D012640 after i.p. injections. 
We measured C_D003975-induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus-maze test, C_D003975-induced sedation by recording the vigilance states, and C_D010852- and C_D010433-induced D_D012640 after i.p. injections. 
Every patient was screened for C_D013739 and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of D_D020018, D_D006177 or C_D013739 less than 4 ng. 
Determining C_D013739 only in cases of D_D020018 or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low C_D013739, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. 
We now advocate that before age 50 years C_D013739 be determined only in cases of D_D020018 and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years. 
Prolactin should be determined only in cases of D_D020018, D_D006177 and/or C_D013739 less than 4 ng. 
C_D013874 pretreatment for C_D015742 injection D_D010146 in ambulatory patients. 
This study investigated C_D015742 injection D_D010146 in patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia. 
We conclude that C_D008012 reduces the incidence and severity of C_D015742 injection D_D010146 in ambulatory patients whereas C_D013874 only reduces its severity. 
We conclude that C_D008012 reduces the incidence and severity of C_D015742 injection D_D010146 in ambulatory patients whereas C_D013874 only reduces its severity. 
Comparison of i.v. C_D006024 and C_D001285 in the prevention of D_D001919 and D_D001145 following repeated doses of C_D013390 in children. 
The effectiveness of administration of C_D006024 5 and 10 micrograms kg-1 and C_D001285 10 and 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. immediately before the induction of anaesthesia, to prevent D_D001145 and D_D001919 following repeated doses of C_D013390 in children, was studied. 
Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with C_D000082 (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of C_D002110 (300 to 450 mg/kg IP) and the onset of fatal D_D012640 by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with C_D000082 (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic D_D012640 produced in the presence of C_D002110 (12.5 to 75 mg/kg IP). 
The frequency of sound-induced D_D012640 after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg C_D002110 was reduced from 50 to 5% by C_D000082. 
In the absence of C_D002110, C_D000082 (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the D_D012640 induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of C_D010433 in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS).

The effect of a 6-week treatment with the C_D002118 channel blocker C_D009568 or the C_D000809 converting enzyme inhibitor C_D004656 on blood pressure, D_D000419, renal hemodynamics, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two-kidney, one clip D_D006978. 
In contrast, in the C_D009568-treated group D_D000419 increased from 12.8 +/- 2 progressively to 163 +/- 55 compared with 19.2 +/- 9 mg/24 hr in the D_D006973 controls. 
C_C023470 and D_D010523. 
D_D010523 has been noted as a complication of therapy with C_C023470, a drug widely used in France (and in clinical trials in the United States) for the prophylactic treatment of D_D000787.

The effect of humoral modulators on the C_D009020-induced D_D006948 of mice was studied. 
The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg of C_D009020-HC1 produced a marked D_D006948 in mice. 
The C_D009020-induced D_D006948 was potentiated by C_D012601 and attenuated by C_D010830. 
The C_D009020-induced D_D006948 was potentiated by C_D012601 and attenuated by C_D010830. 
In contrast, both methC_D012601 and C_D009388, which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, had no effect on the D_D006948 produced by C_D009020.

Mechanisms of C_D016559-induced D_D006973 in the rat. 
The clinical utility of C_D016559 is complicated by substantial D_D006973 and D_D007674. 
The clinical utility of C_D016559 is complicated by substantial D_D006973 and D_D007674. 
To clarify the mechanisms of C_D016559-induced D_D006973, we studied the chronic effects of C_D016559 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial C_D009569 synthase (eC_D009569S) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eC_D009569S and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of C_C035054 on D_D007859 by chronic C_D009020 administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect. 
A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous C_D006493 injection on D_D003288 and D_D010146. 
A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous C_D006493 injection on D_D003288 and D_D010146. 
AIM: This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on D_D003288 and D_D010146 following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of C_D006493. 
AIM: This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on D_D003288 and D_D010146 following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of C_D006493. 
BACKGROUND: Although different methods to prevent D_D003288 and D_D010146 following the subcutaneous injection of C_D006493 have been widely studied and described, the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of D_D003288 and D_D010146 is little documented.

Acute C_D012110 and subchronic C_D006220 treatments change synaptosomal brain C_D018698 uptake and elicit D_D004409 in rats. 
Acute C_D012110 and subchronic C_D006220 treatments change synaptosomal brain C_D018698 uptake and elicit D_D004409 in rats. 
C_D012110- and C_D006220-induced D_D004409 are putative animal models of D_D004409 (D_D004409) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress.

In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with C_D006170 on D_D058186 induced by C_D005839 (C_D005839) D_D007674. 
In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with C_D006170 on D_D058186 induced by C_D005839 (C_D005839) D_D007674. 
The results indicated that concomitant treatment with C_D006170 and C_D005839 significantly increased C_D003404 and C_D014508 by about 183 and 239%, respectively (compared to 432 and 346%, respectively, in rats treated with cellulose and C_D005839), and decreased that of cortical C_D005978 by 21% (compared to 27% in the cellulose plus C_D005839 group) The C_D005839-induced proximal D_D007683 appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given C_D005839 together with C_D006170 than in those given C_D005839 and cellulose. 
D_D006212 associated with C_C022189. 
Although D_D006212 have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent, we describe three patients who experienced complex D_D006212 and altered mental status after C_C022189 treatment was begun or its dosage increased. 
GLEPP1 receptor C_D014443 phosphatase (Ptpro) in rat C_D011692 D_D009401. 
C_D011692 D_D009401 was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of C_D011692 (C_D011692, 20 mg/100g BW). 
Tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after C_D011692 injection so as to include both the acute phase of D_D011507 associated with foot process effacement (days 5-11) and the chronic phase of D_D011507 associated with D_D005921 (days 45-126). 
C_D013988-induced D_D000741: report of three Chinese patients and review of the literature. 
In this study, three Chinese patients with C_D013988-induced D_D000741 were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed. 
D_D000380 occurred 3-20 weeks after initiation of C_D013988, so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended. 
Treatment for C_D013988-induced D_D000741 with colony-stimulating factors seemed to have little effect. 
D_D000647 produced by C_D012601 and C_D003513 were reversed by C_D009020 given 30 min before the test trial (pre-test), and pre-test C_D009020 also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered C_D009270 during the training trial. 
D_D000647 produced by C_D012601 and C_D003513 were reversed by C_D009020 given 30 min before the test trial (pre-test), and pre-test C_D009020 also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered C_D009270 during the training trial. 
Similarly, pre-test C_D012601 partially reversed the C_D012601-induced D_D000647, but not significantly; and pre-test C_D003513 failed to reverse the C_D003513-induced D_D000647. 
Similarly, pre-test C_D012601 partially reversed the C_D012601-induced D_D000647, but not significantly; and pre-test C_D003513 failed to reverse the C_D003513-induced D_D000647. 
C_D001058, a nonselective C_D018491, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce D_D007035, and to produce distinct changes to C_D004298 turnover in the rodent brain. 
In rats, detection of C_D001058-induced D_D006948 was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions. 
Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to C_D001058 such as drug-induced D_D007035. 
C_D010634-induced D_D004409 in a D_D009422 child. 
A 2-year-old child with known D_D009422 developed a D_D004409 soon after starting C_D010634 therapy for D_D012640. 
On repeat challenge with C_D010634, the D_D004409 recurred. 
C_D000641 (C_D000641) was higher in patients who, during continuous therapy, complained of D_D006970 (7 patients) than in those who were symptom-free (17 patients), although C_D014635 plasma levels were similar in both groups. 
C_D000641 (C_D000641) was higher in patients who, during continuous therapy, complained of D_D006970 (7 patients) than in those who were symptom-free (17 patients), although C_D014635 plasma levels were similar in both groups. 
Calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of C_D006220-induced D_D002375 and a partial prevention of C_D001058-induced D_D006948.

Development of C_D007545-induced D_D006332. 
The development of D_D006332 was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of C_D007545 (C_D007545) (0.3 mg/kg body weight). 
Co-D_D063646 effect of C_C009166 on D_D013274 of male F344 rats induced with C_D002083. 
The potential modifying effect of C_C009166 (C_C009166) on C_D002083 (C_D002083)-induced rat D_D013274 was examined. 
In groups given 2% C_D002083, although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals, co-administration of 0.25% C_C009166 significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the incidence of D_D013274 (D_D010212 and D_D002277) to 60% (9/15, 2 rats with D_D002277) from 15% (3/20, one rat with D_D002277) in the group given C_C009166-free water. 
These findings indicate that C_C009166 acted as a co-carcinogen in the C_D002083 D_D013274 of the rat. 
C_D007650 pretreatment reverses C_D015760-induced D_D009127. 
Systemic pretreatment with C_D007650, a relatively specific type-2 C_D012701 receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the D_D009127 produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist C_D015760. 
C_D002707 at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the D_D009127 produced by C_D015760. 
Despite the absence of D_D009127, animals that received C_D007650 (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by C_D015760 were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving C_D015760 alone. 
Use of C_D006024 5 micrograms kg-1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and, given 1 min before the C_D004491, was sufficient to minimize early, C_D004491-induced D_D001919. 
Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in C_D005283-induced D_D009127 in the rat. 
Whereas D_D009127 is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose C_D005283 anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). 
It is speculated that the induction of D_D009127 by C_D005283 may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons. 
The most common adverse effects were D_D009325 and D_D014839 in the C_D005442 group and D_D009325 and injection-site D_D010146 in the placebo group.

Arterial D_D013923 in patients receiving systemic C_D006493 therapy: a complication associated with C_D006493-induced D_D013921. 
Arterial D_D013923 is a recognized complication of systemic C_D006493 therapy. 
Characteristic of the entity is D_D001157 by platelet-fibrin D_D013927 with distal D_D007511 occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of C_D006493 therapy, preceded by profound D_D013921 with platelet counts in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 per cubic millimeter.

Long-term prognosis for transplant-free survivors of C_D000082-induced D_D017114. 
BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant-free survivors of C_D000082-induced D_D017114 remains unknown. 
AIM: To examine whether C_D000082-induced D_D017114 increases long-term mortality. 
METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of C_D000082-induced D_D056486, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. 
On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose C_D000082-induced D_D056486 had caused an D_D017114 (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of D_D017114 died of D_D008107, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups.

CONCLUSIONS: C_D000082-induced D_D017114 did not affect long-term mortality. 
C_D012701 6 receptor gene is associated with C_D008694-induced D_D011605 in a Japanese population. 
The C_D012701 6 (C_D0127016) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as C_D003024 and C_C076029, and C_D003913-induced D_D006948 in rats is corrected with the use of a selective C_D0127016 receptor antagonist. 
The symptoms of C_D008694 (C_D008694)-induced D_D011605 are similar to those of paranoid type D_D012559. 
Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the C_D0127016 gene (HTR6) with C_D008694-induced D_D011605. 
C_D008694OD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 C_D008694-induced D_D011605 patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. 
RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with C_D008694-induced D_D011605 patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. 
In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and C_D008694-induced D_D011605 patients, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of C_D008694-induced D_D011605 in the Japanese population. 
Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on C_D016642-induced D_D012640 in mice. 
BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of C_D016642-induced D_D012640. 
METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg, a known D_D012640 dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of C_D016642-induced D_D012640 in the Swiss albino mice. 
RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced D_D012640 in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1. 
Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of D_D012640 at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection. 
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and D_D012640 dose of C_D016642 and the risk of D_D012640 in a prospective study is novel. 
Although C_D020927 sedation was associated with a 16% incidence of D_D001919, all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20% of age-adjusted normal range and C_D010100 saturations were 95% or higher. 
C_D008694 causes alterations in the MAP kinase-related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased D_D001523. 
D_D001523 have been reported in patients who suffer from some D_D001523, and are common in C_D008694 (C_D008694) abusers. 
Herein, we report that multiple (but not single) injections of C_D008694 significantly increased D_D001523 in male CD-1 mice. 
This increase in D_D001523 was not secondary to C_D008694-induced D_D006948. 
This increase in D_D001523 was not secondary to C_D008694-induced D_D006948. 
C_C047781 associated with exacerbation or de novo D_D009207 in D_C562694. 
Five patients with D_C562694 (D_C562694) treated with C_C047781 (C_C047781) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of D_D009207 (D_D009207). 
In three patients, C_C047781 exacerbated D_D009207 in a dose-dependent manner with early aggravation during titration. 
D_D009207 disappeared when C_C047781 dose was decreased by 25 to 50%. 
In two patients, C_C047781 exacerbated D_D009207 in a delayed but more severe manner, with D_D009207 that only ceased after C_C047781 withdrawal. 
The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in C_D007980-induced D_D004409 are unclear. 
Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in a group of patients with advanced D_D010300, the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a D_D004409 state induced by continuous C_D001058 infusion. 
Assessment of the onset and persistence of D_D000647 during procedural sedation with C_D015742. 
These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from C_D004317-induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute D_D006333 in adult mice in vivo. 
Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in C_D004317 D_D009401. 
C_D000666-induced D_D012640 in a patient with D_D000163. 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of multiple episodes of D_D012640 activity in an D_D000163 patent following C_D000666 infusion. 
CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent grand mal D_D012640 during intravenous infusion of C_D000666, then petit mal D_D012640 as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time. 
Despite administration of C_D010672 and C_D008140, the D_D012640 persisted and occurred only during C_D000666 administration. 
The time course of events suggested that C_D000666 was the cause of the D_D012640 in this D_D000163 patient. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D000666 seems to be the probable cause of the D_D012640. 
To date, only three cases of D_D012640 associated with C_D000666 have been reported in the literature, but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect. 
Chronic effects of a novel synthetic C_D018943 derivative (C_C055866) on normal heart and C_D004317-induced D_D009202 in beagle dogs. 
This study was designed to investigate the chronic D_D066126 potential of C_C055866 and a possible deteriorating effect of C_C055866 on low-grade D_D066126ity pre-induced by C_D004317 in beagle dogs. 
Animals which received over six courses of C_D004317 demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological D_D009202, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the C_C055866 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations. 
To examine a possibly deteriorating D_D066126 effect of C_C055866, low-grade D_D009202 was induced in dogs by four courses of C_D004317 (1.5 mg/kg). 
To examine a possibly deteriorating D_D066126 effect of C_C055866, low-grade D_D009202 was induced in dogs by four courses of C_D004317 (1.5 mg/kg). 
The low-grade D_D066126 changes were enhanced by the additional C_D004317 treatment. 
In conclusion, C_C055866 does not have any potential of chronic D_D066126ity and deteriorating effect on C_D004317-induced D_D066126ity in dogs. 
CONCLUSIONS: In late-stage D_D010300, pallidotomy significantly reduces C_D007980-induced D_D004409 and off-period disability. 
Neuropeptide-Y immunoreactivity in the C_D010862 model of D_D004833. 
The C_D010862 (C_D010862) model of D_D004827 is characterized by an acute period of D_D013226 followed by spontaneous recurrent D_D012640s and related D_D001930.

The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression, including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons, are present in the C_D010862 model of D_D004833. 
Failure of ancrod in the treatment of C_D006493-induced arterial D_D013927. 
The morbidity and mortality associated with C_D006493-induced D_D013927 remain high despite numerous empirical therapies. 
Ancrod has been used successfully for prophylaxis against development of D_D013927 in patients with C_D006493 induced D_D001791 who require brief reexposure to C_D006493, but its success in patients who have developed the D_D013927 syndrome is not well defined. 
The authors present a case of failure of ancrod treatment in a patient with C_D006493-induced D_D013927.

Remodelling of nerve structure in experimental C_D007538 D_D009422 in the rat. 
The D_D009422 caused by a single dose of C_D007538 in rats was studied with a computer-assisted morphometric method. 
Frequencies of D_D014693 were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) after C_C053571 (0%) and C_D007472 (3%) than after C_D008794 (22%). 
During C_D004176-induced D_D006940, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial D_D023921 had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. 
The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in C_D004176-induced D_D006940. 
C_D013793-201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during C_D004176-induced D_D006940; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03). 
D_D058186 in the group pretreated with C_D005665 (p < 0.005 by ANOVA), with a rise in serum C_D003404 from 145 +/- 13 to 182 +/- 16 mumol/l at 24 h, while no change occurred in the control group (from 141 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 7 mumol/l).

The cumulative discontinuation rate due to D_D005767 was significantly lower with C_C422649 than C_D004008 (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)). 
The incidence of discontinuations for D_D006973-related and D_D004487-related AEs were significantly higher with C_C422649 (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with C_D004008 (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for D_D006973 and p<0.01 for D_D004487). 
The incidence of discontinuations for D_D006973-related and D_D004487-related AEs were significantly higher with C_C422649 (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with C_D004008 (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for D_D006973 and p<0.01 for D_D004487). 
CONCLUSIONS: C_C422649 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to D_D005767 compared with C_D004008 150 mg. 
Similarly, D_D001480-related adverse events with C_C069541 + C_D008094/C_D014635 (21.4%) were no different than with PBO + C_D008094/C_D014635 (19.2%). 
Adverse events related to D_D001480 occurred in 59.6% of patients treated with C_D006220 (n = 99) monotherapy, whereas 26.5% of patients treated with C_D008094 (n = 98) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to D_D001480.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that, in lifetime C_D002216-treated spontaneously D_D006973 rats (SHR), the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the D_D006973 effect of C_D017673 supplementation. 
Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker C_D018738 resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the C_D017673-induced D_D006973 in both groups. 
Although low concentrations (less than or equal to 50 ppm) of C_D003345 had beneficial effects on C_C025541-induced D_D009422, greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either C_C025541 or C_D007531.

RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to C_D004656 had a 33% greater likelihood of D_D051437 than controls (P =.003). 
By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and C_D004656 groups older age, C_D004232 therapy, and D_D003920 were associated with D_D051437, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. 
By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and C_D004656 groups older age, C_D004232 therapy, and D_D003920 were associated with D_D051437, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. 
Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing D_D051437 in both groups, but significantly more so in the C_D004656 group (C_D004656: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with C_D004656; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). 
C_D004232 therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of D_D051437 in the C_D004656 group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66). 
C_D004232 therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of D_D051437 in the C_D004656 group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66). 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D004656 use caused a 33% increase in the risk of D_D051437 in patients with D_D006333. 
D_D003920 was associated with an increased risk of D_D051437 in all patients with D_D006333, but this risk was reduced in the C_D004656 group compared with the placebo group. 
C_D010389 induced acute D_D002819|D001264: case report and review of the literature. 
The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with C_D010389 who experienced profound D_D002819|D001264.

Risk of D_D007674 after consumption of nonionic C_D003287 by children undergoing cardiac angiography: a prospective study. 
Despite increasing reports on nonionic C_D003287-induced D_D007674 (D_D007674) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures, the studies in pediatrics are limited, with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography. 
This prospective study determined the incidence of D_D007674 for two nonionic C_D003287 (C_D003287), C_C038192 and C_D007472, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of C_D003287 and the presence of D_D003490. 
This prospective study determined the incidence of D_D007674 for two nonionic C_D003287 (C_D003287), C_C038192 and C_D007472, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of C_D003287 and the presence of D_D003490. 
This prospective study determined the incidence of D_D007674 for two nonionic C_D003287 (C_D003287), C_C038192 and C_D007472, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of C_D003287 and the presence of D_D003490. 
Whereas 33.3% of the patients with D_D007674 were among those who received the proper dosage of C_D003287, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of D_D007674 related to the different dosages of C_D003287 (p = 0.014). 
The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic C_D003287, nor on the presence of D_D003490, and although D_D007674 usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.

Intravenous C_D002110 is commonly used to improve D_D012640 duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign D_D018879. 
Intravenous C_D002110 is commonly used to improve D_D012640 duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign D_D018879. 
We describe a patient with no previous history of D_D006331 or D_D001145 who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of D_D017180 after C_D002110 administration. 
Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with C_D004977-induced D_D009901. 
PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of D_D009410 in C_D004977-induced D_D009901 using optical coherence tomography (OCT). 
A serious complication of C_D004977 is an D_D009901 that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. 
METHODS: Three subjects with a history of C_D004977 (C_D004977)-induced D_D009901 of short-, intermediate-, and long-term D_D014786 were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination. 
METHODS: Three subjects with a history of C_D004977 (C_D004977)-induced D_D009901 of short-, intermediate-, and long-term D_D014786 were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination. 
In all subjects with history of C_D004977-induced D_D009901, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant (patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate D_D014786, 68% loss; patient C, with chronic D_D014786, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26+/-16 microm. 
In all subjects with history of C_D004977-induced D_D009901, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant (patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate D_D014786, 68% loss; patient C, with chronic D_D014786, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26+/-16 microm. 
CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with C_D004977-induced D_D009901 show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers. 
Additionally, in terms of management of C_D004977-induced D_D009901, it is important to properly manage C_D004977 dosing in patients with D_D051437 and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached. 
D_D013927 risk was consistently higher for users of C_D001241 users than nonusers of C_D001241 (placebo, 1.4% vs. 0%; C_C406224, 1.7% vs. 0.2%; NSAIDs, 1.9% vs. 0.5%). 
Nineteen D_D020018 women receiving either C_D005473, C_D020280, or C_D017374 participated in an eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the effects of C_D004809 (50 mg) on self-report measures of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction.

We therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four C_D015632 (C_D015632)-exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit C_D007980-induced D_D004409 to evaluate the locomotor and D_D004409 effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) of C_C095427 (C_C095427), a selective and full C_D004298 D1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action. 
Acute administration of C_C095427 was as efficacious in alleviating C_D015632-induced D_D020734 as C_D007980 and C_C416545, but was less likely to reproduce the C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in these animals than with either C_C416545 or subsequent challenge of C_D007980.

A CD50 dose of local anesthetic (causing D_D012640 in 50% of mice) was fatal in 90% of C_D002045-induced D_D012640, in 57% of the C_C004616 group, and in 6% of the C_D008012 group.

A patient with sinus D_D001919 and D_D054537, induced by C_D002220, prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases. 
A patient with sinus D_D001919 and D_D054537, induced by C_D002220, prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases. 
One patient group developed D_D013616 in the setting of a massive C_D002220 D_D062787. 
The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life-threatening D_D001919 or D_D054537, associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated C_D002220 serum levels.

Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by C_D016202 receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate C_D006220-induced D_D002375. 
The present study examined the influence of excitatory C_D000596-mediated mechanisms in the IC on the D_D002375 induced by the C_D004298 receptor blocker C_D006220 administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats. 
C_D006220-induced D_D002375 was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of C_D018698 C_D016202 receptor antagonists, C_D016291 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and C_C031231 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the C_D016202 receptor agonist C_D016202 (C_D016202, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl). 
The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of C_D016291 and C_C031231 previous to systemic injections of C_D006220 significantly attenuated the D_D002375, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar. 
These findings suggest that C_D018698-mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence C_D006220-induced D_D002375 and participate in the regulation of motor activity. 
Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of C_C507346 reverses C_D006220-induced D_D002375 in rats. 
In addition, C_C507346 reduces the duration of C_D006220-induced D_D002375 in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice. 
C_D009553 prevents D_D008569 caused by C_D005996-induced D_D007022 in adult mice. 
C_D009553 prevents D_D008569 caused by C_D005996-induced D_D007022 in adult mice. 
C_D009553 prevents D_D008569 caused by C_D005996-induced D_D007022 in adult mice. 
We tested the hypothesis that C_D009553 (C_D009553) administered at the onset of C_D005996 (C_D005996)-induced D_D007022 would preserve long-term associative memory. 
We tested the hypothesis that C_D009553 (C_D009553) administered at the onset of C_D005996 (C_D005996)-induced D_D007022 would preserve long-term associative memory. 
Mice subjected to D_D007022 episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, C_D005996 + C_D009553, or delayed C_D005996 (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively). 
Mice subjected to D_D007022 episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, C_D005996 + C_D009553, or delayed C_D005996 (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively). 
CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of C_D005996 immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced D_D007022 had no effect. 
C_D009553 attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by C_D005996 but did not improve latency in the absence of D_D007022. 
C_D009553 attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by C_D005996 but did not improve latency in the absence of D_D007022. 
The observed effect of C_D009553 may have been attributable to the preservation of C_D002118 homeostasis during D_D007022, because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups. 
Fatal D_D010490 and D_D006471 due to possible interaction of cranberry juice with C_D014859. 
We report a case of fatal internal D_D006470 in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of C_D014859. 
C_D007545 induces primary loss of dystrophin in rat hearts: correlation with D_D009202. 
The mechanism of C_D007545-induced D_D009202 is unknown, but a mismatch of C_D010100 supply vs. demand following coronary D_D007022 and D_D009202 is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed. 
These changes, related to D_D007511, explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by C_D007545. 
High C_D004041 diet-fed D_D009765 rats are highly sensitive to C_D004317-induced D_D066126. 
High C_D004041 diet-fed D_D009765 rats are highly sensitive to C_D004317-induced D_D066126. 
Often, chemotherapy by C_D004317 (C_D004317) is limited due to life threatening D_D066126 in patients during and posttherapy. 
Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against C_D004317-induced D_D066126. 
In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high C_D004041 diet (HFD), which induces D_D009765 in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to C_D004317-induced D_D066126. 
In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high C_D004041 diet (HFD), which induces D_D009765 in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to C_D004317-induced D_D066126. 
A LD(10) dose (8 mg C_D004317/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher D_D066126, D_D006331, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the D_D009765 (D_D009765) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. 
A LD(10) dose (8 mg C_D004317/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher D_D066126, D_D006331, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the D_D009765 (D_D009765) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. 
Mechanistic studies revealed that D_D009765 rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac C_D004041ty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in ND versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in D_D009765), (5) decreased mitochondrial C_D000249-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac C_D000255 levels accompanied by decreased C_D000255/C_D000244 ratio after C_D004317 administration. 
In conclusion, HFD-induced D_D009765 rats are highly sensitized to C_D004317-induced D_D066126 by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial C_D000255 generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway. 
Complete D_D054537 secondary to C_D008094 therapy. 
D_D012804 has been reported most frequently among the adverse cardiovascular effects of C_D008094. 
In the present case, complete D_D054537 with D_D013575 developed secondary to C_D008094 therapy, necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation. 
D_D009459 induced by C_C092292 on the second day of treatment. 
We describe a case of D_D009459 (D_D009459) associated with the use of C_C092292. 
Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with D_D009459, atypical antipsychotic drugs like C_C092292 may also be a cause. 
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of D_D012559 who developed signs and symptoms of D_D009459 after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated C_C092292. 
This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) D_D009459 due to C_C092292 reported in the literature. 
Role of C_C013592 on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in C_D007545-induced D_D009203 in rats. 
(Anacardiaceae), on C_D007545 (C_D007545)-induced D_D009203 (D_D009203) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism. 
Subcutaneous injection of C_D007545 (200 mg/kg body weight in 1 ml saline) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused D_D009202 in rat heart, which was determined by the increased activity of serum C_D019344 dehydrogenase (LDH) and C_D003401 phosphokinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), increased C_D014527 level and reduced plasma C_D007501 binding capacity. 
Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non-enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon C_C013592 administration as compared to C_D007545-induced D_D009203 rats. 
From the present study it is concluded that C_C013592 exerts a beneficial effect against C_D007545-induced D_D009203 due to its antioxidant potential, which regulated the tissues defense system against D_D006331. 
C_C071741 pretreatment reduces D_D009207 after C_D005045. 
STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of pretreatment with C_C071741 1 microg/kg and the effect of gender on the incidence of D_D009207 after anesthesia induction with C_D005045. 
In the placebo group, male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of D_D009207 after C_D005045 administration. 
CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with C_C071741 1 microg/kg reduced D_D009207 after C_D005045 induction without side effects such as sedation, D_D001049, D_D009325, or D_D011537. 
Men experience increased incidence of D_D009207 than women after C_D005045 administration. 
Administration of C_C004742 (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse C_D012601-induced D_D000647, according to the results of a Y-maze test. 
These results indicate that C_C004742 might play a role in acetylC_D002794 biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates C_D012601-induced D_D000647. 
Possible C_D017963-associated D_D006606. 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of persistent D_D006606 associated by C_D017963 therapy. 
CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with persistent D_D006606 after beginning C_D017963 for the treatment of D_D010612. 
Discontinuation of C_D017963 and therapy with C_D001418 finally resolved D_D006606. 
Discontinuation of C_D017963 and therapy with C_D001418 finally resolved D_D006606. 
Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by C_D017963 could be the pathogenesis of D_D006606 in our patient. 
Time trends in C_D014859-associated D_D006470. 
The annual incidence of C_D014859-related D_D006470 at Brigham and Women's Hospital increased from 0.97/1,000 patient admissions in the first time period (January 1995 to October 1998) to 1.19/1,000 patient admissions in the second time period (November 1998 to August 2002) of this study. 
C_D005996 induces attacks of D_D020326 in sufferers of D_D020325. 
In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule C_D009569 (C_D009569) is involved in D_D010146 mechanisms of D_D020326. 
In order to clarify whether the same is true for D_D020325, in the present study we examined the D_D006261 response to intravenous infusion of C_D005996 (C_D005996) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of D_D020325. 
D_D006261 was more severe in D_D008881 than in the controls during and immediately after C_D005996 infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). 
D_D006261 was more severe in D_D008881 than in the controls during and immediately after C_D005996 infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). 
In the controls, the C_D005996-induced D_D006261 gradually disappeared, whereas in D_D008881 peak D_D006261 intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. 
In the controls, the C_D005996-induced D_D006261 gradually disappeared, whereas in D_D008881 peak D_D006261 intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. 
Since cortical spreading D_D003866 has been shown to liberate C_D009569 in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading D_D003866 and D_D006261 in D_D020325.

BACKGROUND: C_D013629 is a candidate chemopreventive agent in D_D001943, although the drug may be associated with the development of D_D016889. 
Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of D_D014652 and D_D015228 among women on C_D013629.

A measure of D_D011681 as a marker of C_D003042-induced D_D010259. 
A measure of D_D011681 as a marker of C_D003042-induced D_D010259. 
C_D003042-induced D_D010259 (D_D010259) remains an important drug-induced model of idiopathic D_D010259 for which no psychophysiologic marker has yet emerged. 
Measures of D_D011681 were able to significantly distinguish a group of abstinent C_D016578 C_D003042 abusers endorsing past D_D010259 (n = 32) from another group of C_D016578 addicts who denied past D_D010259 (n = 29).

D_D012640 induced by combined C_D008728-C_D016666 treatment. 
We report a case of combined C_D008728-C_D016666 treatment-induced D_D012640. 
Why may C_D015119 (C_D015119) induce D_D009135 in man? 
A case of necrotizing D_D009135 due to a short C_D015119 (C_D015119) treatment in a 72 year-old patient with D_D013345 (D_D013345) is described. 
Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or D_D007172 while taking C_D002927 and in all cases these changes disappeared when C_D002927 was replaced by C_D011899. 
D_D012202 syndrome may be disappearing from Australia despite a total lack of association with C_D012459s or C_D001241 ingestion, since there were no cases found at The Children's Hospital in 1983, 1984, or 1985. 
A rare case of morbid D_D014652, together with striking angiographic findings, is described secondary to the ingestion of C_D008784 by a 48-year-old woman. 
A discussion of the history of C_D004876 includes its original discovery, the epidemics of D_D005734 that it has caused through the ages and its past and present role in the management of D_D008881. 
Despite the advent of C_D002118 channel blockers and beta-adrenergic antagonists, C_D004876 preparations continue to play a major role in D_D008881 therapy, so that the danger of D_D004881 persists. 
The time course and concentration-effect relationship of C_D013726-induced D_D007008 was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling. 
In spite of higher C_D013726 concentrations after C_D010096 pretreatment, the D_D007008 was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2-blocking action. 
Midline B3 C_D012701 nerves in rat medulla are involved in D_D007022 effect of C_D008750. 
Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of C_D008750 onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 C_D012701 neurons in the medulla elicits a D_D007022 response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord. 
In spontaneously D_D006973, D_D020521-prone rats, microinjection of C_D008750 into the area of the midline B3 C_D012701 cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent D_D007022 of 30-40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the C_D012701 neurotoxin C_D015116 (C_D015116) injected intracerebroventricularly. 
It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a C_D008750-induced D_D007022 via descending projections, the midline C_D012701 B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the D_D007022 action of C_D008750, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem. 
A single case report suggests that C_D015016 may be used to treat the D_D020018 of C_D002997. 
D_D004342 immune reaction as a mechanism for C_D007741-associated D_D056486. 
D_D004342 immune reaction as a mechanism for C_D007741-associated D_D056486. 
OBJECTIVE: To assess lymphocyte reactivity to C_D007741 and to serum containing putative ex vivo C_D007741 antigens or metabolites in a case of C_D007741-induced D_D056486. 
PATIENT: A 58-year-old woman with a clinical diagnosis of C_D007741-induced D_D056486. 
CONCLUSIONS: The methodology used allowed the detection of lymphocyte sensitization to sera containing ex vivo-prepared C_D007741 antigens, suggesting the involvement of an immunologic mechanism in C_D007741-induced D_D056486. 
Reversible D_D006332 induced by C_D016559 in a pediatric heart transplant recipient: case report. 
Herein we describe transient D_D006332 induced by C_D016559 after heart transplantation. 
Thus, we conclude that C_D016559 induces reversible D_D006332. 
Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 58.4 +/- 6.8 years; 7 men, 3 women) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease (mean disease time, 8.4 +/- 3.5 years), disabling motor fluctuations (Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3-5 in off-drug phases) and C_D007980-induced D_D004409 were selected. 
Protective effects of antithrombin on C_D011692 D_D009401 in rats. 
We investigated the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors, in rats with C_D011692-induced D_D009401, which is an experimental model of human D_D009404. 
We investigated the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors, in rats with C_D011692-induced D_D009401, which is an experimental model of human D_D009404. 
C_D011692-induced D_D007674 and D_D006949 were also suppressed. 
These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of C_D011692-induced D_D009404. 
Reverse or inverted D_D054549 (reverse D_D054549) in a young woman in the setting of C_D000661 use. 
In this article, we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse D_D054549 syndrome occurring after C_D000661 use. 
C_D000661-induced D_D006948 was similar in all groups. 
Peripheral C_D007505 induced D_D009410 in rat substantia nigra. 
To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral C_D007501 overload and C_D004298rgic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra (SN), in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry, C_D014443 hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, Perls' C_D007501 staining, and high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection to study the D_D009410 and increased C_D007501 content in the SN of C_D007505 overloaded animals. 
These results suggest that peripheral C_D007505 can increase the C_D007501 level in the SN, where excessive C_D007501 causes the D_D009410. 
Second, we investigated the effect of IT C_D016291 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after C_D009020-induced D_D020336. 
IT C_D016291 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after C_D009020-induced D_D020336 compared with the saline group. 
These data indicate that IT C_D009020 induces D_D020336 with a concomitant increase in CSF C_D018698, which is involved in C_D016202 receptor activation. 
beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to D_D012640, as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for C_D010862-induced D_D012640, but seemed normal in other neurological tests. 
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for C_D003042 or C_D000661 in adult emergency department D_D012640 patients. 
Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or C_D000431-related D_D012640 disorder, estimated time from D_D012640 to sample collection, history or suspicion of C_D003042 or C_D000661 abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. 
CONCLUSIONS: During this study period, routine plasma screening for C_D003042 and C_D000661s in adult D_D012640 patients had a low yield. 
The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on D_D010300 'off' signs and C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D004409). 
We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative C_D007980 responsiveness of motor signs and the C_D007980 responsiveness of scores in timed tests (Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in D_D004409. 
The differential predictive value of C_D007980 responsiveness for the outcome of D_D010300 'off' signs and D_D004409 and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with D_D004409 and D_D010300 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of D_D010300 'off' signs and D_D004409. 
METHODS: C_D011692 (C_D011692) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce D_D011507. 
While C_D008148 and C_D019821 have been associated with toxic D_D009135, C_D017035-associated D_D009135 could represent a distinct, inflammatory entity. 
While C_D008148 and C_D019821 have been associated with toxic D_D009135, C_D017035-associated D_D009135 could represent a distinct, inflammatory entity. 
Dose-effect and structure-function relationships in C_D004317 D_D009202. 
The D_D009202 (D_D009202) produced by the anticancer drug C_D004317 (C_D004317) (C_D004317) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose-effect and structure-function relationships during development of D_D009202. 
In C_D004317-D_D009202 D_D009202 is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult (C_D004317 dose) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached, after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly. 
Fatal D_D000741 following topical administration of ophthalmic C_D002701. 
A 73-year-old woman died of D_D000741 less than two months after undergoing D_D002386 extraction and beginning topical therapy with C_D002701. 
The pattern of the D_D000741 was associated with an idiosyncratic response to C_D002701. 
This was the second report of fatal D_D000741 after topical treatment with C_D002701 for ocular conditions, although two cases of reversible D_D001855 have also been reported. 
D_D001919 due to C_D014282. 
Experimental C_D016572 D_D007674: risk of concomitant chemotherapy. 
The role of C_D016572 (C_D016572) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of D_D007674 was evaluated in rats. 
The combined administration of C_D016572 and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a D_D007674 potential, such as C_D005839 (at therapeutic doses), C_D000666 and C_D007654, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the C_D016572 induced D_D064420 in the rat model. 
The combined administration of C_D016572 and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a D_D007674 potential, such as C_D005839 (at therapeutic doses), C_D000666 and C_D007654, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the C_D016572 induced D_D064420 in the rat model.

C_D005839 at toxic doses, however, increased C_D016572 D_D007674. 
C_D005839 at toxic doses, however, increased C_D016572 D_D007674. 
Thus, the D_D007674 induced by C_D016572 has a different pathogenetic mechanism. 
Receptor mechanisms of C_D009538-induced D_D006948 in chronic C_D009538-treated rats. 
These results suggest that chronic C_D009538-treated rats develop D_D006948 in response to C_D009538 initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and C_D004298 concentration, followed by inducing C_D004298 receptor supersensitivity in the striatum. 
C_D006854-induced D_D006973 in humans: pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function. 
The D_D006973 with C_D006854 is associated with an D_D016534 (presumably due to increased blood volume). 
Although C_D013496 has been associated with the development of D_D058186 in greater than 100 subjects, the mechanism of damage remains unclear. 
In summary, C_D013496 causes D_D058186, most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of C_D014527. 
C_D003042-induced brainstem D_D012640 and behavior. 
Increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha-hydroxylation of C_D003840 in C_D004997-induced D_D002779 in rats. 
We conclude that in patients with chronic D_D003324 who are not in clinical congestive D_D006333 D_D002303 after C_D010042 administration even when it is initially normal.

These results suggest that C_D011453 are involved in the mechanism(s) underlying C_D005481- and C_D010433-induced D_D012640, but not C_D010852-, electroshock-, or C_D001640-induced D_D012640.

C_D014635 I: time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers, D_D056486, and C_D014635 metabolite levels in rats. 
To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between C_D014635-associated oxidative stress and D_D056486, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with C_D014635 (500 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10, or 14 days. 
Overall, these findings indicate that C_D014635 treatment results in oxidative stress, as measured by levels of C_C075750, which precedes the onset of D_D009336, D_D005234, and elevated levels of serum alpha-GST.

D_D002375 induced by combinations of C_D007649 and C_D009020: potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat. 
D_D002375 induced by combinations of C_D007649 and C_D009020: potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat. 
Previous studies demonstrated that both C_D007649 and C_D009020 induced D_D000699 and D_D002375 in the rat. 
Previous studies demonstrated that both C_D007649 and C_D009020 induced D_D000699 and D_D002375 in the rat. 
Pre-treatment with C_D007649 produced cross-tolerance to C_D009020, whereas pretreatment with C_D009020 did not induce cross-tolerance to C_D007649 but rather augmented the D_D002375 response; this augmentation was attributed to residual C_D009020 in the brain.

Latency to the loss of righting reflex, D_D009127 and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of C_D007649 or C_D009020 in each combination. 
D_D058186 in patients with D_D000163 on C_C096918 while receiving prolonged C_D014640 course for D_D010019. 
BACKGROUND: A transient D_D056784 mimicking D_D002544 has been described as a complication of chemotherapy, most commonly in recipients of intrathecal C_D008727 for childhood D_D007938. 
RESULTS: We identified 27 reports of toxic D_D056784 in patients treated with C_D008727 (intrathecal, systemic), C_D005472 and its derivative C_C017367, and C_C110904.

Alterations of C_D009638 transporter (NET) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to D_D012640 induce by C_D003042 and local anesthetics were studied in mice. 
Daily administration of C_D003891 increased the incidence of appearance of C_D008012-induced D_D012640 and decreased that of C_D003042-induced D_D012640. 
Daily administration of C_D003891 increased the incidence of appearance of C_D008012-induced D_D012640 and decreased that of C_D003042-induced D_D012640. 
Co-administration of C_D008012 with C_D003891 reversed the changes of D_D012640 activity of C_D008012 and C_D003042 induced by repeated administration of C_D003891. 
Co-administration of C_D008012 with C_D003891 reversed the changes of D_D012640 activity of C_D008012 and C_D003042 induced by repeated administration of C_D003891. 
These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of C_D003891 may be relevant to C_D003891-induced sensitization of C_D008012 D_D012640. 
C_D003891-induced sensitization of C_D008012 D_D012640 may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of C_D003042. 
C_D003891-induced sensitization of C_D008012 D_D012640 may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of C_D003042. 
Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of C_D012254-induced D_D006461, and this D_D000740 can be problematic in patients with D_D006526, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. 
Although C_D012254-associated D_D000740 can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. 
Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage C_D012254-associated D_D000740 but has other potential disadvantages. 
C_C026956, a liver-targeting prodrug of C_D012254, has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of C_D012254 while decreasing the risk of hemolytic D_D000740 in patients with D_D019698. 
C_D002119 D_D064420: the updated D_D006934; report of 3 cases and review of the literature. 
OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 patients with C_D002119-induced D_D006934 and gain insights into the cause and management of the D_D006934. 
The 2 patients with the higher serum C_D002118 concentrations received C_C019248 intravenously (60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe D_D006996. 
CONCLUSION: D_D006934 may be a common cause of unexplained D_D006934 and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested C_D002119 in susceptible persons. 
C_C019248 treatment is associated with considerable risk for D_D006996, even in cases of initially severe D_D006934. 
Management strategies for C_D012254-induced D_D000743 in the treatment of D_D006526: clinical and economic implications. 
Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: C_D012254-induced D_D000743 (D_D000743). 
The standard of care for management of D_D000743 is reduction or discontinuation of the C_D012254 dosage. 
Questions remain about the optimal dose of C_D012254 and the incidence of D_D000743 in a real-world population. 
D_D006970 and D_D013651 were increased significantly over placebo only in the high-dose C_C020976 group. 
D_D006970 and D_D013651 were increased significantly over placebo only in the high-dose C_C020976 group. 
One case of acute D_D006934 and two of recurrent D_D053040 are reported in patients who had regularly consumed large amounts of C_D002119-C_D017693 powders for more than 20 years. 
One case of acute D_D006934 and two of recurrent D_D053040 are reported in patients who had regularly consumed large amounts of C_D002119-C_D017693 powders for more than 20 years. 
The long-term use of C_D003473 (C_D003473) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged D_D018908, although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear. 
We report 3 patients (age 37-52 years) with acute D_D012131 who developed prolonged D_D018908 following the discontinuation of C_D003473s. 
The D_D018908 in these patients is due to D_D009468 (most likely due to C_D003473) and muscle (most likely due to C_D000305).

C_D015232-induced D_D053201 in normal, conscious rats: involvement of C_D015320? 
Compared to C_D000584 treatment, the C_D002752 phase was associated with an increased frequency of D_D018879 (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation. 
C_D005680 involvement in C_D009270 induced reversal of D_D012133 produced by C_D013874. 
In this study C_D009270 reversed D_D012133 induced by C_D013874 in rats. 
These data suggest C_D009270 reverses D_D012133 produced by C_D013874 and involves C_D005680 in its action. 
C_D015230 (0.5-3 ng/mouse) had a D_D006930 action on the response to a hot plate during a 3-60 min period after injection. 
C_D015232 showed a D_D006930 effect at doses of 1 C_D011453 to 10 ng/mouse, but the effect lasted shorter (3-30 min) than that of C_D015230. 
C_D015232 showed a D_D006930 effect at doses of 1 C_D011453 to 10 ng/mouse, but the effect lasted shorter (3-30 min) than that of C_D015230. 
The D_D006930 effect of C_D015230 was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist (greater than or equal to 100 ng) but not by C_C053876, a prostanoid EP1-receptor antagonist. 
Conversely, C_D015232-induced D_D006930 was blocked by C_C053876 (greater than or equal to 500 ng) but not by the substance P antagonist. 
These results demonstrate that both C_D015230 and C_D015232 exert D_D006930 in the spinal cord, but in different ways. 
These results demonstrate that both C_D015230 and C_D015232 exert D_D006930 in the spinal cord, but in different ways. 
Swallowing-induced D_D013617 triggered by C_D000420: case report and review of the literature. 
CONCLUSION: C_D000420 is presented here as a possible trigger for D_D013617. 
C_C024989 treatment ameliorates acute C_D002945 D_D007674 in mice. 
The nephroprotective effect of C_C024989 was investigated in mice with D_D058186 induced by a single i.p. injection of C_D002945 (5 mg/kg). 
Also, histopathological D_D007674 mediated by C_D002945 was ameliorated by C_C024989 treatment. 
It was concluded that C_C024989 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute C_D002945 D_D007674 commonly encountered in clinical practice. 
C_D008687 prevents experimental C_D005839-induced D_D007674 by a mitochondria-dependent pathway. 
C_D008687 treatment fully blocked C_D005839-mediated D_D058186. 
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients (>or=65 years) without preoperative D_D003693 or severe D_D003704 who underwent D_D006620 repair under spinal anesthesia with C_D015742 sedation. 
CONCLUSION: The use of light C_D015742 sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative D_D003693 by 50% compared with deep sedation. 
C_C471405-induced acute D_D009203 due to D_D003329. 
We report the first case of C_C471405-induced D_D003329. 
RESULTS: The results indicate that C_D002939- and C_D009643-treated rats showed D_D001008 in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied.

Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to C_D015215-induced D_D009202. 
METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component C_D015215 (C_D015215; C_D015215) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of D_D002311, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of C_D015215 (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml). 
In contrast, C_D015215-treated FasL Tg mice developed D_D002311 and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles. 
C_D014635-induced D_D002819 and D_D001927 in atypical D_D020158. 
C_D014635-induced D_D002819 and D_D001927 in atypical D_D020158. 
This report describes a patient with mild D_D007805 and D_D008607, who was found to have D_D020158 following her presentation with acute D_D001927 and D_D002819 shortly after initiation of C_D014635 therapy.

Microinjection of C_D016713 into the CA1 region of hippocampus improves C_D012601-induced D_D000647 in adult male rats. 
The effect of C_D016713 (5-HT2 antagonist) on C_D012601 (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist)-induced D_D000647 in Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated. 
Our findings show that microinjection of C_D016713 into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the C_D012601-induced D_D000647. 
With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical D_D000860 in the C_D011692-induced D_D009404 and focal and segmental D_D000860 in the remnant kidney model. 
With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical D_D000860 in the C_D011692-induced D_D009404 and focal and segmental D_D000860 in the remnant kidney model. 
Expression of the D_D000860-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the C_D011692 model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes. 
However, caution is required when C_D003520 or C_D018943 such as C_D008942 are used in patients with a possible underlying D_D006331, for example, D_D012595 patients.

C_C052342-induced D_D053040. 
We report the first two cases of C_C052342-induced D_D053040 in the urologic literature. 
C_D013148: is it a novel drug for the prevention of C_D000666-related D_D007008 in D_D009369 patients? 
OBJECTIVE: D_D007674 is the major adverse effect of C_D000666 (C_D000666), often limiting administration of full dosage. 
This study was designed to assess the ability of C_D013148 to reduce C_D011188 requirements and to prevent D_D007008 in D_D009503 patients on C_D000666 treatment. 
CONCLUSION: This study showed that C_D013148 can reduce C_D011188 requirements and prevent D_D007008 by reducing urinary C_D011188 loss in D_D009503 patients on C_D000666 treatment. 
Here we analyze the occurrence of D_D012640 and D_D020258 in D2R -/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist C_D010862. 
However, C_D010862-induced D_D012640 result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R -/- brains in comparison to C_D007608.

Treatment of C_D018967-induced D_D006966 with a C_D004298 agonist in children. 
BACKGROUND: C_D018967, a potent antagonist of both serotonergic (5HT2A) and C_D004298rgic D2 receptors is associated with D_D006966 in adults and children. 
We report the successful treatment of C_D018967-induced D_D006966 with C_C047047 in youth. 
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with C_D018967-induced D_D006966 treated with C_C047047. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_C047047 may be useful for the treatment of C_D018967-induced D_D006966 in youth; however, further research is needed. 
D_D041781 associated with the use of C_D008687. 
We report a patient who developed D_D041781 shortly after initiation of treatment with C_D008687 hydrochloride. 
Electro-oculography, electroretinography, visual evoked potentials, and multifocal electroretinography in patients with C_D020888-attributed D_D014786. 
PURPOSE: Symptomatic D_D014786 thought to be associated with C_D020888 has been reported. 
The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known C_D020888-attributed D_D014786, three of whom were reported previously. 
CONCLUSION: Marked D_D014786 appears to be associated with C_D020888 therapy. 
The indications for switch were chronic C_D016572 or C_D016559 nephroD_D064420 (12), acute C_D016572 or C_D016559 D_D064420 (3), severe D_-1 (2), D_D008232 (D_D008232) in remission (2), and hepatoD_D064420 in 1. 
Worsening of C_D007980-induced D_D004409 by motor and mental tasks. 
Ten patients who had D_D010300 with disabling D_D004409 were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental (mental calculation) and motor (flexion/extension of right fingers, flexion/extension of left fingers, flexion/extension of the neck, speaking aloud) tasks on the worsening of peak-dose D_D004409 following administration of an effective single dose of C_D001058. 
D_D028361 in C_D004317-induced D_D009202 in mice: suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression. 
D_D028361 in C_D004317-induced D_D009202 in mice: suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression. 
Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with C_D004317 caused D_D001145 characterized by D_D001919, extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent D_D004487, fusion, dissolution, and/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment. 
Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of C_D004317 on cardiovascular function involve D_D028361. 
Enhanced D_D001919 induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with C_D007538. 
High doses of C_D007538 increase D_D007022 induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex D_D013610 to D_D001919, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain C_D005680 (C_D005680). 
High doses of C_D007538 increase D_D007022 induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex D_D013610 to D_D001919, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain C_D005680 (C_D005680). 
In the present study, the possible enhancement by C_D007538 of D_D001919 induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with C_D002698-C_D014520. 
C_D007538 significantly increased D_D001919 after C_D011433, C_D010869, C_D007741 and C_D001262, as well as after C_D003000, but not after C_D018738 or C_D002217. 
C_D007538 significantly increased D_D001919 after C_D011433, C_D010869, C_D007741 and C_D001262, as well as after C_D003000, but not after C_D018738 or C_D002217. 
C_D007538 significantly increased D_D001919 after C_D011433, C_D010869, C_D007741 and C_D001262, as well as after C_D003000, but not after C_D018738 or C_D002217. 
Epileptogenic activity of C_D005492 after drug induces D_D008180 (C_D005492 and D_D004827) 
CONCLUSIONS: The D_D004827 pregnant patient's D_D001327 (probably drug-induced D_D008180) could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of C_D005492 triggered a cluster of D_D012640. 
CONCLUSIONS: The D_D004827 pregnant patient's D_D001327 (probably drug-induced D_D008180) could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of C_D005492 triggered a cluster of D_D012640. 
Physiological dose (<1 mg) of C_D005492 both in healthy and 60 D_D004827 women, all without any D_D001327, did not increase the risk for D_D004827 D_D012640. 
C_D017291-induced D_D017180. 
Although the side-effect profile of C_D004917 is established, including D_D005759 and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed-function oxidase metabolism, experience with the newer C_D018942s is still being recorded. 
Persistent D_D018500 following C_D008094 therapy. 
Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have C_D008094-induced D_D018500, and C_D008094 therapy had been discontinued. 
He remained thirsty and D_D011141 despite cessation of C_D008094 and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and C_D014667 secretion, with clear evidence of D_D018500. 
He remained thirsty and D_D011141 despite cessation of C_D008094 and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and C_D014667 secretion, with clear evidence of D_D018500. 
C_D008094 induced D_D018500 is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but D_D011141 persisted in this patient for ten years after C_D008094 was stopped. 
C_D008094 induced D_D018500 is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but D_D011141 persisted in this patient for ten years after C_D008094 was stopped. 
We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with C_D008094-induced D_D018500. 
The incidence of C_D004317-induced D_D066126 is high and increases with follow-up, irrespective of cumulative dose. 
D_D014652 of C_D008874 versus C_D003975. 
D_D014652 of C_D008874 versus C_D003975. 
Although some studies have suggested fewer D_D014652 are associated with C_D008874 than with C_D003975 for endoscopic procedures, this variable has not been well documented.

We prospectively evaluated the incidence of D_D014652 after intravenous injection of C_D003975 or C_D008874 in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. 
We prospectively evaluated the incidence of D_D014652 after intravenous injection of C_D003975 or C_D008874 in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. 
Overall, D_D014652 were more frequent with C_D003975 (22 of 62 patients) than with C_D008874 (4 of 60 patients) (p < 0.001).

Loss of C_D018698 decarboxylase mRNA-containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following C_D010862-induced D_D012640. 
Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with C_D010862, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after C_D010862-induced D_D012640. 
Protective effect of C_D016595 on C_D007213 induced D_D007674 in elderly patients. 
CONCLUSION: Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing C_D007213 related D_D007674. 
Its antiarrhythmic effectiveness surpasses that of C_D011433 and C_D010869 inhibiting the C_D010042 D_D001145 in dogs and cats. 
D_D002819 associated with C_D003276. 
Three patients developed D_D002819 while receiving C_D003276. 
The third patient had acute C_D000661-induced D_D002819 after prolonged C_D003276. 
The third patient had acute C_D000661-induced D_D002819 after prolonged C_D003276. 
C_D000641 D_D003128 was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol C_D000643. 
C_D006493-induced D_D013921 after liver transplantation. 
BACKGROUND: C_D006493 (C_D006493) or C_D006495 (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent D_D013927 after liver transplantation. 
C_D006493-induced D_D013921 (D_D013921) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to C_D006493, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%. 
The frequencies of D_D013921 after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/C_D006493-reactive antibody (D_D013921 antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown. 
None of the subjects/patients developed C_D006493-related D_D013921. 
C_D011441-associated D_D014657 in a girl with D_D014424 and D_D006111. 
The diagnosis of C_D011441 (C_D011441)-associated D_D014657 was made by observation of consistent clinical features, the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood, and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of C_D011441. 
C_D013390-induced D_D014313 during bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body. 
Here, we describe a case of severe D_D014313 (D_D014313) after C_D013390 (C_D013390) administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body. 
Minor D_D009422, cognitive development, and somatic development at the age of 3 to 7 years after C_D003907 treatment in very-low birth-weight infants. 
The objective of this study was to assess minor D_D009422, cognitive development, and somatic development after C_D003907 therapy in very-low-birthweight infants. 
After C_D003907 treatment, children showed a higher rate of minor D_D009422s. 
Force overflow and C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in D_D010300. 
We assessed force coordination of the hand in D_D010300 and its relationship to motor complications of C_D007980 therapy, particularly to C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D004409). 
We studied two groups of D_D010300 patients with (D_D010300 + D_D004409, n = 23) and without C_D007980-induced D_D004409 (D_D010300 - D_D004409, n = 10), and age-matched healthy controls. 
The motor score of the Unified D_D010300 Rating Scale, a D_D004409 score and force in a grip-lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF C_D007980. 
In D_D010300 + D_D004409, the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by C_D007980 (by 61%, P < 0.05). 
Postinfarction D_D018658 associated with long-term C_D013256 therapy. 
Two cases of postinfarction D_D018658 in patients on long-term C_D013256 therapy are presented and the favourable outcome in both cases described. 
A possible association between C_D013256 therapy and subsequent postinfarction D_D018658 is discussed. 
D_D000799 associated with C_D004329 administration. 
C_D017291-associated D_D006212 in a patient with D_D007676 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. 
Unreported in the literature is D_D006212 occurring in association with the new C_D018942 antibiotic, C_D017291. 
A 3 times higher D_D011507 appeared in animals treated with C_D004317NP than in those treated with C_D004317. 
D_D011507 appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after C_D004317 treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between C_D004317NP and C_D004317. 
Both effects (better survival and D_D009401) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of C_D004317NP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells. 
C_D005047-related D_D009203. 
The occurrence of a D_D009203 is reported after chemotherapy containing C_D005047, in a man with no risk factors for D_D003327. 
Subjective assessment of D_D020018 of patients on long-term administration of C_D004077. 
Fatal D_D000741 due to C_D007213--lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro. 
Although C_D007213 has been implicated as a possible cause of D_D000741 on the basis of a few clinical observations, its role has not been definitely established. 
A case of fatal D_D000741 is described in which no drugs other than C_D000493 and C_D007213 were given. 
A positive lymphocyte transformation test with C_D007213 in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing D_D000741 in a susceptible patient. 
Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of D_D009404 induced in the rat by C_D011692. 
This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in D_D009404 induced by C_D011692 were due to D_D009404 per se, or, at least in part, to the C_D011692. 
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of C_D011692 (20 mg/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of D_D009404. 
Acid protease (cathepsin D) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived D_D017114 after C_D000082 D_D062787, whereas activities were increased equally in patients with D_D017114 due to D_D006525 whether or not they survived. 
Transketolase abnormality in C_D014042-induced D_D014899. 
We studied a C_D013831-dependent enzyme, transketolase, from fibroblasts of a D_D003920 patient who developed D_D014899 when treated with C_D014042, in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [high Km for C_D013831 pyrophosphate (C_D013835)], as previously reported in postalcoholic D_D020915. 
These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic D_D020915 and the patient with C_D014042-induced D_D014899 from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality. 
Mechanisms of D_D017202 induced by C_D004837: comparison with exercise-induced D_D007511. 
The role of C_D004837 in eliciting D_D017202 was examined in patients with D_D003324. 
Both C_D004837 and exercise produced D_D017202 as evidenced by ST segment D_D003866 and D_D000787. 
However, the mechanisms of D_D017202 induced by C_D004837 were significantly different from those of exercise. 
Exercise-induced D_D017202 was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while C_D004837-induced D_D007511 was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. 
Transient D_D009069 following unilateral D_-1 reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by C_D000661. 
In order to clarify the nature of this initial D_D009069 we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on C_D000661-induced D_D009069. 
A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when C_D000661 was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the D_D009069. 
However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, C_D000661 dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), C_D000661-induced D_D009069 tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further C_D000661 injections. 
These findings suggest that C_D000661 has an irreversible effect on the post-lesion DA pool contributing to D_D009069. 
It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both D_D018500 and D_D007037 during C_D008094 treatment. 
It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both D_D018500 and D_D007037 during C_D008094 treatment. 
D_D007037 developed in eight patients while they were taking C_D008094. 
The D_D000740 induced by C_D015215 (C_D015215) is poorly understood. 
We have used a murine model of D_D000163, D_D007239 of female C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine D_D007938 (MuLV) virus, to determine if C_D015215-induced D_D000740 is due, in part, to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors (BFU-e) to erythropoietin (EPO). 
C_D015215 produced D_D000740 in both groups, in a dose-dependent fashion. 
Despite the D_D000740, the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU-e in C_D015215 treated mice increased up to five-fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment. 
The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in C_D015215 treated mice were appropriate for the degree of D_D000740 observed when compared with C_C030299 (C_C030299) treated mice. 
The numbers of BFU-e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in C_D015215 and C_C030299 treated mice with similar degrees of D_D000740. 
However, D_D045262 was inappropriate for the degree of D_D000740 observed in C_D015215 treated infected mice. 
C_D015215-induced peripheral D_D000740 in the face of increased numbers of BFU-e and increased levels of plasma EPO suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation. 
Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in C_D004317-induced D_D009202 with C_D019797. 
Using a rat model of C_D004317-induced D_D009202, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in C_D004317 D_D009202. 
The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight D_D009202 (scattered or focal D_C536522) indicates that C_D019797 scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of C_D004317-induced D_D009202. 
D_D000647 associated with C_D011433 D_D064420: a case report. 
Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the C_D007649-induced D_D013610, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery. 
The use of serum cholinesterase in C_D013390 D_D001049. 
Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged D_D001049 lasting several hours after C_D013390 have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase. 
The use of serum cholinesterase in C_D013390 D_D001049 provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist. 
D_D007024 occurs following alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade in chronic C_D011224-pretreated conscious spontaneously D_D006973 rats. 
However, the head-up tilt induced D_D007024 in the SHR treated with C_D011224 (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with C_D015016 (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 
Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce D_D007024 when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of C_D011224 (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.). 
The pressor responses and D_D001919 to the alpha 1-agonist C_C014282 (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist C_C056299 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and C_D009638 (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic C_D011224 pretreatment. 
The pressor responses and D_D001919 to the alpha 1-agonist C_C014282 (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist C_C056299 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and C_D009638 (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic C_D011224 pretreatment. 
The pressor responses and D_D001919 to the alpha 1-agonist C_C014282 (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist C_C056299 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and C_D009638 (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic C_D011224 pretreatment. 
Both the pressor and D_D001919 effects of C_C014282 were abolished in chronic C_D011224 treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4). 
On the other hand, the pressor effects of C_C056299 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying D_D001919 was greater in SHR with chronic C_D011224 treatment than without such treatment. 
Furthermore, the D_D001919 that accompanied the C_D009638-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic C_D011224 treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR. 
C_D002738 related complete D_D006327 with D_D001766: case report. 
A 27-year old African woman with history of regular C_D002738 ingestion presented with progressive D_D015354, easy D_D005221, D_D004417, D_D004244 progressing to D_D013575.

Ophthalmological assessment revealed features of C_D002738 D_D012164, cardiac assessment revealed features of D_D006333 and a complete D_D006327 with D_D002037 pattern. 
Ophthalmological assessment revealed features of C_D002738 D_D012164, cardiac assessment revealed features of D_D006333 and a complete D_D006327 with D_D002037 pattern. 
Ophthalmological assessment revealed features of C_D002738 D_D012164, cardiac assessment revealed features of D_D006333 and a complete D_D006327 with D_D002037 pattern. 
The D_D006327 was treated by pacemaker insertion and the D_D006333 resolved spontaneously following C_D002738 discontinuation. 
The cumulative doses of levoC_D002045 and C_C037663 that produced D_D012640 were similar and were larger than those of C_D002045. 
The cumulative doses of levoC_D002045 and C_C037663 that produced D_D012640 were similar and were larger than those of C_D002045. 
The cumulative doses of levoC_D002045 that produced D_D001145 and D_D006323 were smaller than the corresponding doses of C_C037663, but they were larger than those of C_D002045. 
The cumulative doses of levoC_D002045 that produced D_D001145 and D_D006323 were smaller than the corresponding doses of C_C037663, but they were larger than those of C_D002045. 
We conclude that the systemic D_D064420 of levoC_D002045 is intermediate between that of C_C037663 and C_D002045 when administered at the same rate and that C_C037663-induced D_D006323 appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by C_D002045 or levoC_D002045. 
BACKGROUND: C_D002117 therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with D_D051437 but has several drawbacks, including D_D006934 and/or marked D_D001851, which may lead to D_D001851. 
BACKGROUND: C_D002117 therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with D_D051437 but has several drawbacks, including D_D006934 and/or marked D_D001851, which may lead to D_D001851. 
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though C_C051883 does not completely prevent the occurrence of D_D006934 in experimental dogs with D_D051437, it may be of use in the management of D_D006962 because it does not induce D_D001851 and, therefore, does not increase the risk of D_D001851. 
D_D002543 associated with C_D010665 in combination with C_D002110. 
D_D002543 associated with C_D010665 in combination with C_D002110. 
C_D010665 (C_D010665) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including D_D020521. 
In order to determine if C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D020521 in normotensive and/or D_D006973 rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days. 
In order to determine if C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D020521 in normotensive and/or D_D006973 rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days. 
A single C_D010665/C_D002110 administration (same dose) lead to acute D_D006973 in both the normotensive and D_D006973 animals. 
These results suggest that C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D002543 in previously D_D006973 animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage. 
These results suggest that C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D002543 in previously D_D006973 animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage. 
Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant C_D003891 IP to produce D_D007022, QRS prolongation, and D_D001919. 
Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant C_D003891 IP to produce D_D007022, QRS prolongation, and D_D001919. 
The incidence of D_D001145 (p = 0.004) and D_D012640 (p = 0.03) in the C_D002122 group was higher than the other groups. 
The DLT included D_D006934, and may be predicted by serum C_D015474 levels. 
The effect of C_D002122 injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), D_D015878, D_D014202 and D_D004830 produced by C_D002217 and C_D010830 injected similarly was investigated.

On the other hand, D_D015878, D_D014202 and D_D004830 evoked by C_D002217 and C_D010830 were not significantly changed by C_D002122.

Although most patients were receiving several drugs, C_D013881 (C_D013881) appeared to be responsible for five cases of D_D017180, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. 
C_D009661 (C_D009661) and C_D000639 (C_D000639) each produced D_D002037 in a 73 year old woman.

Serotonergic drugs, C_D001569 and C_D001418 block C_D009118-induced D_D009207 in a strain of mice. 
In male Swiss mice, C_D009118 produced D_D009207. 
Considering the fact that C_D006916 and the C_D001569 have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical D_D009207, the C_D009118-induced D_D009207 seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition. 
Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L., C_C029036 on C_D013311-induced model of sporadic D_D000544 in male rats. 
In the present study, the effect of C_C029036s on sporadic D_D000544 induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) C_D013311 (C_D013311) in male rats was investigated. 
In D_D000544 groups, rats were injected with C_D013311-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar C_D013311-icv application was repeated. 
CONCLUSION: Therefore, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of C_C029036 (30 mg/kg) in antagonizing the D_D003072 caused by C_D013311-icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of D_D019636 such as D_D000544.

Continuous topical use of immunomodulators such as C_D016559 or C_C117268 should be regarded as a potential cause of rosaceiform D_D003872, although many cases have not been reported. 
This study was designed to evaluate the effects of C_D010862 and explore the underlying ionic mechanism, using both C_D000157-induced rat and C_D010042-induced guinea pig D_D001145 models.

Dual effects of C_D008550 on C_C032232-induced D_D053608 in rats. 
C_D008550 affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced D_D053608. 
C_D008550 pre-treatment affected in a dual manner C_C032232 D_D053608, however, no dose-effect correlation was found. 
In contrast, the highest dose of C_D008550 (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of D_D053608, and a reduction in mortality rate. 
C_D008550 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of C_D007649- or C_D003975-induced D_D053608. 
C_D008550 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of C_D007649- or C_D003975-induced D_D053608. 
C_D008550 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of C_D007649- or C_D003975-induced D_D053608. 
Thus, the dual action of C_D008550 on pharmacological D_D053608 seems to be specific for the C_C032232 mechanism of action. 
Effects of C_C049860 on cholinesterase and C_D012601-induced D_D000647. 
Effects of C_C049860 on cholinesterase and C_D012601-induced D_D000647. 
The effects of C_C049860 on cholinesterase, C_D012601-induced D_D000647 and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well-known cholinesterase inhibitors C_D013619 and C_C076946.

All compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o. significantly improved the D_D000647 induced by C_D012601 (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task. 
These findings suggest that C_C049860 at a low dose (0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.) improves C_D012601-induced D_D000647 but does not affect spontaneous movement.

D_D009203 in pregnancy associated with C_D002996 for ovulation induction: a case report. 
D_D013923 is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with C_D002996. 
CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between C_D002996 and D_D009203. 
D_-1 and D_D002761 related to long-term C_D010634 therapy: an autopsy report of two patients. 
C_D010634 (C_D010634) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that C_D010634-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic D_D008107. 
Our findings illustrate that C_D010634 may be associated with chronic D_D008107, which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences. 
C_D004977-associated D_D009901. 
INTRODUCTION: C_D004977 is used in the treatment of D_D014376, which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent D_D014786. 
CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with C_D004977-associated toxic D_D009901 are described. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D004977 usage is associated with permanent D_D014786 and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up. 
Furthermore, 18.28% of patients with a history of chronic D_D014581 and 11.8% of subjects with an history of C_D000894-induced D_D014581/D_D000799 or D_D000799 alone (with or without chronic D_D014581) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs. 
However, the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic D_D014581 and, above all, by a history of C_D000894-induced D_D000799. 
Effects of C_D014700 on D_D001281 and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs. 
METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of D_D001281 promotion by C_D002118(2+) channel blockers, we administered C_D014700 to C_D009020-C_D002698 anesthetized dogs. 
RESULTS: C_D014700 caused D_D001281 promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of D_D001281 induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. 
In these experiments, C_D014700 shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of D_D001281 (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005). 
C_D004110 did not affect ERP, D_D001281 cycle length or D_D001281 duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by C_D014700 (n=5). 
In the presence of autonomic blockade, C_D014700 failed to promote D_D001281 and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. 
Epicardial mapping suggested that C_D014700 promoted D_D001281 by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D014700 promotes D_D001281 in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by C_D004110.

Lifetime treatment of mice with C_D015215 (C_D015215) produces D_D009190. 
C_D015215 has induced a D_D000748 in D_D000163 patients on long term C_D015215 therapy. 
Above mentioned C_D015215 incorporation may have induced an ineffective hemopoiesis in the primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells, which is known to be seen commonly in the D_D009190. 
Influence of diet free of C_D009243-precursors on C_D000082 D_D056486 in mice. 
Recently, we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of C_D009536, a selective inhibitor of C_D011064 polymerase (PARP; EC 2.4.2.30) on mice suffering from C_D000082 (C_D000082)-D_D056486, suggesting that the C_D000082-induced D_D056486 involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation. 
The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of C_D009243, the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with C_D000082 D_D056486 and evaluates the influence of simultaneous C_D000431 consumption in these animals. 
The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of C_D009243, the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with C_D000082 D_D056486 and evaluates the influence of simultaneous C_D000431 consumption in these animals. 
In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of C_D000082, and unlike the exacerbation caused by C_D000431 in mice on a standard diet, the D_D056486 was inhibited by 50% by C_D000431. 
In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of C_D000082, and unlike the exacerbation caused by C_D000431 in mice on a standard diet, the D_D056486 was inhibited by 50% by C_D000431. 
A further 64% reduction of D_D056486 was observed, when C_D009536 was given to C_D000431/C_D000082-mice. 
Our results provide evidence that the C_D000082-induced D_D056486 and its exacerbation by C_D000431 can either be reduced by end-product inhibition of PARP by C_D009536 or by dietary depletion of the enzyme's substrate C_D009243.

We see the main application of C_D009536 as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of C_D000082 in order to avoid D_D056486 in patients treated with this widely used analgesic. 
Using two-stage coronary ligation-, C_D004071-, and C_D004837-induced canine D_D001145, antiarrhythmic effects of C_C032151 were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each D_D001145 model was determined. 
Using two-stage coronary ligation-, C_D004071-, and C_D004837-induced canine D_D001145, antiarrhythmic effects of C_C032151 were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each D_D001145 model was determined. 
C_C032151 suppressed all the D_D001145s, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for D_D001145s induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, C_D004071, and C_D004837 were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7). 
C_C032151 suppressed all the D_D001145s, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for D_D001145s induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, C_D004071, and C_D004837 were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7). 
The concentration for C_D004837-induced D_D001145 was significantly higher than those for the other types of D_D001145s. 
Immunopathology of C_D010396-induced D_D007674. 
Four patients with D_D001172 developed heavy D_D011507 after five to 12 months of treatment with D-C_D010396. 
Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces D_D006470 volume in a mouse model of C_D014859-associated intracerebral D_D006470.

This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting C_D000431-related fetal D_D006130. 
Any C_D000431 consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in D_D006130 as well as D_D006130 in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers. 
Absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after C_D003042-associated D_D013345. 
Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with C_D003042-associated D_D013345 (D_D013345) who underwent angiography shortly after C_D003042 use. 
METHODS: We screened patients with D_D013345 retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for C_D003042 or its metabolites. 
CONCLUSION: No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or D_D014657 could be found in patients who underwent angiography after D_D017542 D_D013345 associated with C_D003042 use. 
CONCLUSION: No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or D_D014657 could be found in patients who underwent angiography after D_D017542 D_D013345 associated with C_D003042 use. 
The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B-cell D_C535648 and D_D009223, the most common form of adult D_D009136, and sudden D_D001281 following one cycle of C_D004317-based chemotherapy in the same patient. 
C_D006220 (1 mg/kg ip) induced D_D010300-like D_D009127, measured as an increased resistance of a rat's hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint. 
C_C095756 in doses of 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl diminished the C_D006220-induced D_D009127. 
Acute cholestatic D_D056486 after exposure to C_D007530. 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of acute cholestatic D_D056486 following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic C_D007530. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D007530, a common anesthetic agent, can cause severe cholestatic D_D056486. 
Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels during C_D009569-induced D_D006261 in patients with chronic tension-type D_D006261. 
It has been proposed that C_D009569 (C_D009569) induced D_D006261 in primary D_D006261s may be associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). 
In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during D_D006261 induced by the C_D009569 donor C_D005996 (C_D005996) in 16 patients with chronic tension-type D_D006261 and 16 healthy controls. 
In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during D_D006261 induced by the C_D009569 donor C_D005996 (C_D005996) in 16 patients with chronic tension-type D_D006261 and 16 healthy controls. 
The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 microg/kg/min C_D005996 or placebo over 20 min on two D_D006261-free days. 
Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate D_D006261 on the C_D005996 day than on the placebo day and the D_D006261 was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls. 
The present study indicates that C_D009569-induced immediate D_D006261 is not associated with release of CGRP. 
D_D017202 due to D_D003329 during C_D004280 stress echocardiography. 
D_D017202 due to D_D003329 during C_D004280 stress echocardiography. 
C_D004280 stress echocardiography (DSE) is a useful and safe provocation test for D_D017202. 
The aim of the present study is to examine whether D_D017202 due to D_D003329 is induced by C_D004280. 
The aim of the present study is to examine whether D_D017202 due to D_D003329 is induced by C_D004280. 
These findings indicate that C_D004280 can provoke D_D003329 in some patients with D_D000788.

C_D009569 synthase expression in the course of C_D007854-induced D_D006973. 
C_D009569 synthase expression in the course of C_D007854-induced D_D006973. 
We recently showed elevated reactive C_D010100 species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of C_D009569 metabolites (C_D009569x), and increased C_D009569 sequestration as C_C002744 in various tissues in rats with C_D007854-induced D_D006973. 
We recently showed elevated reactive C_D010100 species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of C_D009569 metabolites (C_D009569x), and increased C_D009569 sequestration as C_C002744 in various tissues in rats with C_D007854-induced D_D006973. 
This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary C_D009569x in C_D007854-induced D_D006973 is, in part, due to depressed C_D009569 synthase (C_D009569S) expression. 
This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary C_D009569x in C_D007854-induced D_D006973 is, in part, due to depressed C_D009569 synthase (C_D009569S) expression. 
C_D014810 supplementation ameliorated D_D006973, lowered plasma C_D008315 concentration, and raised urinary C_D009569x excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eC_D009569S and iC_D009569S expression. 
In conclusion, C_D007854-induced D_D006973 in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eC_D009569S and iC_D009569S expression. 
In conclusion, C_D007854-induced D_D006973 in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eC_D009569S and iC_D009569S expression. 
This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated C_D009569 inactivation, C_D007854-associated inhibition of C_D009569S activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with D_D006973.

BACKGROUND: The most striking of C_D016190's advantages (C_D016190) over C_D002945 (C_D002945) is its markedly reduced rate of D_D020258 effects. 
However, the use of C_D016190 higher-intensity schedules and the association with other D_D020258 drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to D_D010523. 
However, the use of C_D016190 higher-intensity schedules and the association with other D_D020258 drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to D_D010523. 
RESULTS: C_D016190 administration induced dose-dependent peripheral D_D020258ity. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D016190 is D_D020258 in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by C_D002945 that it is probable that D_D020258ity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism. 
We have investigated the association between D_D016889 and C_D013629 use or other treatments in women treated for D_D001943 in a case-control study. 
Women who had received C_D013629 were significantly more likely to have D_D016889 diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). 
Women who had D_D016889 and had received C_D013629 had more D_D020178 and poorer prognosis than those with D_D016889 who had not received this treatment. 
Our results suggest a causal role of C_D013629 in D_D016889, particularly when used as currently proposed for D_D001943 prevention. 
D_D016889 diagnosed in women treated with C_D013629 have poorer prognosis. 
CONCLUSION: Patients with C_D013629-induced D_D017093 may be at increased risk for granulosa cell D_D009369 because of alterations in C_D013629 metabolism. 
A murine model of D_D062788: the effects of D_D006966 induced by C_D005473, a selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitor, on D_D062788 induction in Wistar albino rats. 
A murine model of D_D062788: the effects of D_D006966 induced by C_D005473, a selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitor, on D_D062788 induction in Wistar albino rats. 
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether C_D005473 given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused D_D006966 and its effects with respect to D_D062788. 
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether C_D005473 given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused D_D006966 and its effects with respect to D_D062788. 
DESIGN: C_D005473, a C_D012701 reuptake inhibitor, was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce D_D006966. 
Histological studies revealed 11 cases of D_D062788, all within the noncastrated group receiving C_D005473. 
Effects of deliberate D_D007022 induced by C_D007741 with C_D007530 on neuropsychological function. 
Effects of deliberate D_D007022 induced by C_D007741 with C_D007530 on neuropsychological function. 
Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate D_D007022 induced by C_D007741 with C_D007530 (D_D007022 group). 
Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate D_D007022 induced by C_D007741 with C_D007530 (D_D007022 group). 
The results indicate that D_D007022 induced by C_D007741 with C_D007530 has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia.

In patients premedicated with C_D012601 + C_D009020 (+5 mg C_D009567 the evening before surgery), the sleep-inducing effect of C_D008874 0.15 mg/kg i.v. was clearly slower in onset than that of C_D013874 4.67 mg/kg i.v. Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the C_D008874 group, but, although D_D001049 occurred less often in the C_D008874 group it lasted longer.

D_D066126 and possible leukemogenic effects of C_D004317 in nonhuman primates. 
8 of the 10 monkeys developed D_D006333 at an average cumulative C_D004317 dose (310 mg/m2) well below that considered the safe upper limit (550 mg/m2) in man. 
1 of the 10 monkeys developed D_D015470 after receiving 324 mg/m2 of C_D004317; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug. 
C_D004317 D_D009202 in children with left-sided D_D009396. 
Two children with D_D009396 of the left kidney experienced severe C_D018943 D_D009202 after irradiation to the D_D009369 bed and conventional dosage of C_D004317. 
The D_D009202 is attributed 1) to the fact that radiation fields for left D_D009396 include the lower portion of the heart and 2) to the interaction of C_D004317 and irradiation on cardiac muscle. 
Conventional LW rats, implanted with C_D013739 at age 4 months, developed a higher incidence of D_D011471 after an average interval of 14 months: 24% had developed gross D_D009369, and 40% when it included microscopic D_D009369. 
Preliminary results indicate that C_D013739-treated LW rats that were fed the same diet, which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20% fat, developed D_D011471 after intervals of 6-12 months. 
Conventional SD rats fed diet L-485 and treated with C_D013739 developed only D_D011472. 
C_D016685 associated D_D006463. 
C_D016685 associated D_D006463 (D_D006463) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. 
It consists of microangiopathic D_D000743, D_D013921 and progressive D_D051437 associated with C_D016685 treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. 
The D_D051437 usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of C_D016685 treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from D_D051437 or D_D011654. 
We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with D_D013274 who developed D_D051437 and D_D013921 while on treatment with C_D016685 and died in D_D011654. 
We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing C_D005472 infusion for treatment of solid D_D009369 in order to assess the incidence of D_D007511 ST changes. 
D_D000787 episodes were rare: only one patient had D_D000787 (during C_D005472 infusion). 
The incidence of D_D007511 episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to C_D005472 infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during C_D005472 infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before C_D005472 v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during C_D005472 (P less than .01). 
We conclude that C_D005472 infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of D_D007511, particularly among patients with D_D003324. 
Lethal D_D001002 complicating high dose C_D007069 chemotherapy in a D_D001943 patient with an D_D007674. 
Lethal D_D001002 complicating high dose C_D007069 chemotherapy in a D_D001943 patient with an D_D007674. 
A sixty-year-old woman with advanced D_D001943, previously treated with C_D002945, developed an irreversible lethal D_D051437 with D_D001002, the day after 5 g/m2 bolus C_D007069. 
C_D007069 is a known D_D007674 drug with demonstrated D_D007674. 
We strongly suspect that this lethal D_D001002 was mainly due to C_D007069, occurring in a patient having received previous C_D002945 chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient D_D007022. 
We recommend careful use of C_D007069 in patients pretreated with D_D007674 chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion. 
Central D_D020246 and topical C_C015173. 
A report is given on an 83-year-old female who acquired central D_D020246 in her seeing eye one day after having started topical medication with C_C015173 for advanced D_D005901 discovered in the other eye. 
Amelioration of C_D001539-induced D_D007008 by C_D013999. 
The beta adrenergic blocking drug, C_D013999, tended to correct the D_D007008 of short-term C_D001539 treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was significant. 
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of C_D018967-induced D_D006966 on trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents. 
RESULTS: D_D006966 was present in 49% of 83 boys (n = 41) treated with C_D018967 for a mean of 2.9 years. 
Of 13 documented D_D050723, 3 occurred after C_D018967 and SSRIs were started, and none occurred in patients with D_D006966. 
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to link C_D018967-induced D_D006966 and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents. 
D_D012640 associated with C_D064704: case presentation and literature review. 
PURPOSE: We present a case of a patient who developed D_D012640 shortly after initiating treatment with C_D064704 and to discuss the potential drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in this case, as well as in other cases, of C_D064704-induced D_D012640. 
RESULTS: Six cases of C_D064704-induced D_D012640 have been reported in the literature. 
Mice lacking mC_D011453ES-1 are resistant to C_D008094-induced D_D011141. 
Cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of C_D008094-induced D_D011141. 
The present study was undertaken to assess C_D008094-induced D_D011141 in mice deficient in microsomal C_D011453 E synthase-1 (mC_D011453ES-1). 
In contrast, mC_D011453ES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to C_D008094-induced D_D011141 and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine C_D011453E(2) and cAMP output. 
We conclude that mC_D011453ES-1-derived C_D011453E(2) mediates C_D008094-induced D_D011141 likely via inhibition of AQP2 and NC_D011188CC2 expression. 
Recently, a number of commercial lots of C_D006493 products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated C_D002809 (OSCS) derivative that could elicit a D_D007022 response in pigs following a single high-dose infusion. 
C_D004317 D_D009202-induced D_D007249 and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B1 receptor. 
Clinical use of the C_D018943 C_D004317 (C_D004317) is limited by its D_D066126 effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis. 
To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) during the development of C_D004317 D_D009202, we studied B1R knockout mice (B1R(-/-)) by investigating cardiac D_D007249 and apoptosis after induction of C_D004317-induced D_D009202. 
C_D004317 control mice showed D_D006331 measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo. 
In C_D004317 B1R(-/-) mice, D_D006331 was improved compared to C_D004317 control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state. 
These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in C_D004317 D_D009202 in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis. 
These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B1R antagonists for treatment of human C_D004317 D_D009202. 
D_D056486 associated with C_D012460 in inflammatory D_D001168: A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events. 
Patients', who had D_D056486 on C_D012460 and met a definition of a serious ADR, were identified. 
The likely frequency of D_D056486 with C_D012460 was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions. 
The likely frequency of serious D_D056486 with C_D012460 was estimated at 0.4% of treated patients. 
CONCLUSION: Serious D_D056486 associated with C_D012460 appears to be under-appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important. 
An evaluation of C_D000583 D_D007674 in the hematology/oncology population. 
To evaluate C_D000583-associated D_D007674 in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. 
The occurrence of D_D007674 by means of an increase in serum C_D003404 and evaluation of efficacy via C_D000583 serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed. 
In contrast, no evidence of D_D008569 was observed in moderate C_D018817 users. 
While the use of C_D018817 in quantities that may be considered "moderate" is not associated with D_D008569, heavy use of C_D018817 use may lead to long lasting D_D008569s. 
Aging process of epithelial cells of the rat prostate lateral lobe in experimental D_D006966 induced by C_D006220. 
C_D013739he aim of the study was to examine the influence of D_D006966, induced by C_D006220 (C_D006220) on age related morphology and function changes of epithelial cells in rat prostate lateral lobe. 
Does supplemental C_D001205 increase D_D002318 risk in women with D_D003920? 
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between C_D001205 intake and mortality from D_D002318. 
DESIGN: We studied the relation between C_D001205 intake and mortality from total D_D002318 (n = 281), D_D003324 (n = 175), and D_D020521 (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being D_D003920 at baseline. 
Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of D_D003324 were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for D_D002318 risk factors, type of D_D003920 medication used, duration of D_D003920, and intakes of C_D005492, C_D014810, and C_D019207, the adjusted relative risks of total D_D002318 mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total C_D001205 intake from food and supplements. 
C_D001205 intake was unrelated to mortality from D_D002318 in the nonD_D003920 subjects at baseline. 
CONCLUSION: A high C_D001205 intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of D_D002318 mortality in postmenopausal women with D_D003920. 
Absolute and attributable risk of D_D054556 in women on combined C_D017373 and C_D004997. 
Absolute and attributable risk of D_D054556 in women on combined C_D017373 and C_D004997. 
OBJECTIVE: To achieve absolute risk estimates of D_D054556 (D_D054556) among women on C_D017373 plus C_D004997 (C_D017373/C_D004997), and among women on C_D003277 (C_D003277).

OBJECTIVE: To achieve absolute risk estimates of D_D054556 (D_D054556) among women on C_D017373 plus C_D004997 (C_D017373/C_D004997), and among women on C_D003277 (C_D003277). 
RESULTS: During the time frame of the study, 330 women were found to have had D_D054556 while on C_D003277. 
The corresponding absolute risk of D_D054556 was 3.4 (range, 3.1-3.8) per 10 000 women years among the women on C_D003277, 4.2 (range, 3.2-5.2) per 10 000 women years among women on C_D016912-containing C_D003277, and 3.1 (range, 1.3-4.9) per 10 000 women years among the women on C_D017373/C_D004997. 
The corresponding absolute risk of D_D054556 was 3.4 (range, 3.1-3.8) per 10 000 women years among the women on C_D003277, 4.2 (range, 3.2-5.2) per 10 000 women years among women on C_D016912-containing C_D003277, and 3.1 (range, 1.3-4.9) per 10 000 women years among the women on C_D017373/C_D004997. 
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the absolute risk of D_D054556 among Danish women on C_D003277 is similar to that among women taking C_D017373/C_D004997.

Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of C_D008748 (C_D008748), an inducer of P4501A1/1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of C_D001556 induced D_D012640, pretreatment with C_D010634 (PB), an inducer of P450 2B1/2B2 or C_D000431, an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of C_D001556 induced D_D012640. 
Similarly, when the P450-mediated metabolism of C_D001556 was blocked by C_C018021 incidence of D_D012640 was increased in animals treated with C_D001556 indicating that C_D001556 per se or its metabolites formed by PB or C_D000431 inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral D_D064420. 
D_D012640 associated with D_D012892 and sustained-release C_D016642. 
This case report describes a generalized D_D012640 associated with sustained-release C_D016642 use and D_D012892. 
After 5 weeks of C_D016642 use, the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic D_D012640 after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence. 
We suggest that D_D012892 may add to the risk of C_D016642-associated D_D012640s. 
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the D_D007674 effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, C_C044834, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, C_D007472. 
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the D_D007674 effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, C_C044834, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, C_D007472. 
CONCLUSIONS: D_D007674 induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when C_C044834 is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium. 
Experimental cranial D_D010146 elicited by C_D002211: a PET study. 
A small amount of C_D002211 was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning D_D010146ful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. 
D_D009459 with C_D018967. 
The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of D_D001480 with C_D018967 at low dosages. 
A 73-year-old woman developed D_D009459 after monotherapy with C_D018967. 
It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with C_D018967 does not ensure protection from D_D009459. 
D_D009404 was induced by a single injection of C_D011692 (C_D011692). 
Although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after C_D011692 injection, when D_D009404 was clearly established, hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change. 
These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute D_D009404 induced by C_D011692. 
C_D003520 associated D_D001749--a highly aggressive disease: analysis of 12 cases. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 55 years) with C_D003520 associated D_D001749 were reviewed. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D003520 associated D_D001749 is an aggressive disease. 
D_D001416 after spinal anaesthesia involving hyperbaric 5% C_D008012. 
Leg and/or back D_D010146 is associated with the intrathecal use of hyperbaric 5% C_D008012. 
Acute blood pressure elevations with C_D002110 in men with borderline systemic D_D006973. 
Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of C_D002110 are enhanced in D_D006973 persons has not been demonstrated. 
Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved D_D006973 BP levels after C_D002110 ingestion. 
Thus, in borderline D_D006973 men, exaggerated responses to C_D002110 were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline D_D006973s. 
D_D006212 and C_D007069-induced D_D020258. 
BACKGROUND: D_D006212 as a symptom of central D_D020258 are a known but poorly described side effect of C_D007069. 
Most cases of C_D007069-induced D_D006212 have been reported with other mental status changes. 
METHODS: The authors interviewed six persons with C_D007069-induced D_D006212 in the presence of a clear sensorium. 
The clinician should be alerted for possible C_D007069-induced D_D006212, which may occur without other signs of D_D020258. 
C_D002747-induced D_D009901. 
A 65-year-old woman with D_D003924 treated with C_D002747 (C_D002747) had a toxic D_D009901 that resolved with discontinuation of C_D002747 therapy. 
C_D007980-induced D_D004409 and thalamotomy. 
C_D007980-induced D_D004409 of the limbs in thirteen cases of D_D010302, which was choreic, ballistic or D_D020821 in type, was alleviated almost completely by stereotaxic surgery using a microelectrode technique for the ventralis oralis anterior and posterior nuclei of the thalamus, but much less by the ventralis intermedius nucleus. 
Control of C_D007980-induced D_D004409s by D_D013786 in the course of routine treatment of D_D010302 is discussed. 
Factors associated with D_D007674 and clinical outcome in patients receiving C_D000583. 
Data from 60 patients treated with C_D000583 were analyzed for factors associated with D_D007674. 
Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic D_D007674 secondary to long-term therapy with C_D016572. 
We think that even these lower dosages of C_D016572 can cause chronic D_D007674 and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect. 
Reversible D_D002779 with D_D002779 following C_D001379 therapy. 
A 67-year-old patient, with primary D_D017285 and without previous evidence of D_D008107, developed clinical and biochemical features of severe D_D002779 3 months after initiation of C_D001379 therapy. 
It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible C_D001379-induced D_D002779 associated with histological evidence of D_D002779. 
Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged C_D007530-induced D_D007022 in humans. 
The effect of C_D007530-induced D_D007022 on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects. 
D_D007022 was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the C_D007530 inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg. 
We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during C_D007530-induced D_D007022 and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed. 
The drug effect studied was the antagonism by C_D008790 of C_D013726-induced D_D007008. 
C_D015313-induced immune D_D000743. 
D_D058186 subsequent to the administration of C_D012293. 
The patients had developed transient D_D051437 after the intermittent administration of C_D012293. 
D_D006509 immune globulin (HBIG) and immune serum globulin (ISG) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing D_D006509 after needle-stick exposure to D_D006509 surface antigen (C_D006514)-positive donors. 
D_D020230 from C_C047426-C_D014191 interaction. 
Effect of nonC_D004298rgic drugs on C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in C_D015632-treated monkeys. 
A group of four monkeys was rendered D_D020734 with the toxin C_D015632. 
A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than C_D004298 were then tested in combination with C_D007980 to see if the D_D004409 movements would be modified. 
Neuroactive C_D013256 protect against C_D010862- and C_D007608-induced limbic D_D012640 and D_D013226 in mice. 
Neuroactive C_D013256 protect against C_D010862- and C_D007608-induced limbic D_D012640 and D_D013226 in mice. 
Neuroactive C_D013256 protect against C_D010862- and C_D007608-induced limbic D_D012640 and D_D013226 in mice. 
Neuroactive C_D013256 protect against C_D010862- and C_D007608-induced limbic D_D012640 and D_D013226 in mice. 
Several structurally related metabolites of C_D011374 (C_D011374) and C_D003900 (C_D003900) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against C_D010862-, C_D007608- and C_D016202 (C_D016202)-induced D_D012640 in mice. 
Several structurally related metabolites of C_D011374 (C_D011374) and C_D003900 (C_D003900) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against C_D010862-, C_D007608- and C_D016202 (C_D016202)-induced D_D012640 in mice. 
C_D013256 with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against C_D010862 (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor D_D012640 and D_D013226 (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). 
C_D013256 with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against C_D010862 (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor D_D012640 and D_D013226 (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). 
Although the neuroactive C_D013256 were considerably less potent than the C_D001569 C_D002998 in protecting against C_D010862 D_D012640, C_D013256 with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for D_D012640 protection) than C_D002998, indicating that some neuroactive C_D013256 may have lower relative D_D064420. 
C_D013256 with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic D_D012640 induced by C_D007608 (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the D_D012640. 
However, when a second dose of the C_D013256 was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the C_D007608-induced limbic D_D012640 and D_D013226 was obtained. 
However, when a second dose of the C_D013256 was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the C_D007608-induced limbic D_D012640 and D_D013226 was obtained. 
We conclude that neuroactive C_D013256 are highly effective in protecting against C_D010862- and C_D007608-induced D_D012640 and D_D013226 in mice, and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of D_D013226 in humans.

In a 12-week controlled study C_C084820 was compared to C_D001590 in the treatment of D_D010302 induced by C_C017610 in 60 D_D012559 outpatients. 
However, C_D001590 treated patients had a significant increase in D_D004409 compared to their condition during C_D011352 treatment, and significantly more D_D001008 and D_D003866 than C_C084820 treated patients. 
However, C_D001590 treated patients had a significant increase in D_D004409 compared to their condition during C_D011352 treatment, and significantly more D_D001008 and D_D003866 than C_C084820 treated patients.

Effect of C_D024502 and C_D003676 on C_D008694-induced D_D020258. 
C_D008694 (C_D008694)-induced C_D004298rgic D_D020258 is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals. 
This study examined the effect of C_D024502 (C_D024502), a scavenger of reactive C_D010100 species, and C_D003676 (C_D003676), an C_D007501 chelator, on the C_D008694-induced D_D020258. 
C_D024502 and C_D003676 attenuated the C_D008694-induced D_D005334 as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity. 
This suggests that C_D024502 and C_D003676 ameliorate the C_D008694-induced D_D009422 by decreasing the level of oxidative stress. 
AIM: Hemorrhagic cystitis (D_D006470|D003556) is a limiting side-effect of chemotherapy with C_D007069 (C_D007069). 
In the study presented here, we investigated the use of C_D003907 in combination with C_D015080 for the prevention of C_D007069-induced D_D006470|D003556. 
In the study presented here, we investigated the use of C_D003907 in combination with C_D015080 for the prevention of C_D007069-induced D_D006470|D003556. 
CONCLUSION: C_D003907 in combination with C_D015080 was efficient in blocking C_D007069-induced D_D006470|D003556. 
CONCLUSION: C_D003907 in combination with C_D015080 was efficient in blocking C_D007069-induced D_D006470|D003556. 
However, the replacement of last two doses of C_D015080 with saline or all of the C_D015080 doses with C_D003907 did not prevent D_D006470|D003556. 
C_D012110 (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in D_D009069, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of D_D004409. 
C_D012110 also produced D_D014202 and D_D002375, which are signs suggestive of D_D010300. 
C_D012110 also produced D_D014202 and D_D002375, which are signs suggestive of D_D010300. 
C_D016291 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and D_D002375 induced by C_D012110. 
However, C_D016291 injection produced a significant increase of D_D014202 in C_D012110-treated mice. 
On the other hand, C_D012110 induced increases in D_D014202 and D_D002375 compared to control mice. 
On the other hand, C_D012110 induced increases in D_D014202 and D_D002375 compared to control mice. 
C_D016291 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the D_D002375 and D_D014202 induced by C_D012110. 
C_D016291 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the D_D002375 and D_D014202 induced by C_D012110. 
Pretreatment with C_D012110 (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in D_D014202 and D_D002375, whereas C_D016291 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of C_D012110. 
Pretreatment with C_D012110 (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in D_D014202 and D_D002375, whereas C_D016291 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of C_D012110. 
These results show that C_D012110 produces different and D_D004409, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as D_D010300-like and D_D004409 signs. 
Effect of C_D005996 on the sphincter of Oddi D_D013035 evoked by C_D009388-C_D009020 administration. 
OBJECTIVE: In this study the effect of C_D005996 on the C_D009388-C_D009020-induced sphincter of Oddi D_D013035 was evaluated in nine female patients with D_D046628. 
OBJECTIVE: In this study the effect of C_D005996 on the C_D009388-C_D009020-induced sphincter of Oddi D_D013035 was evaluated in nine female patients with D_D046628. 
METHOD: Sphincter of Oddi D_D013035 was induced by C_D009388-C_D009020 administration (0.5 mg C_D009388 intramuscularly and 10 mg C_D009020 subcutaneously) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. 
METHOD: Sphincter of Oddi D_D013035 was induced by C_D009388-C_D009020 administration (0.5 mg C_D009388 intramuscularly and 10 mg C_D009020 subcutaneously) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. 
RESULTS: C_D009388-C_D009020 provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete D_D013035 at the level of the sphincter of Oddi. 
CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of C_D005996 on the C_D009020-induced sphincter of Oddi D_D013035 in humans. 
Since C_D005996 is able to overcome even the drastic effect of C_D009020, it might be of relevance in the treatment of D_D046628. 
C_D014221herefore, 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline (C), C_D008775 (C_D008775), or C_D014221 (C_D014221) 80 mg/kg/d for 5 d. Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant D_D000855 in the C_D013256-treated groups (-50 and -79% in C_D008775 and C_D014221, respectively). 
C_D014221herefore, 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline (C), C_D008775 (C_D008775), or C_D014221 (C_D014221) 80 mg/kg/d for 5 d. Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant D_D000855 in the C_D013256-treated groups (-50 and -79% in C_D008775 and C_D014221, respectively). 
C_D014221his was associated with a similar D_D015431. 
AC_D014221Pase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber D_D009133 in the C_D013256 groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa D_D009133 with C_D014221, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of D_D009336. 
Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, C_D014221, and PF), showed that muscle D_D009133 was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in C_D014221-treated animals.

BACKGROUND: D_D000743 is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of C_D007372 and C_D012254. 
BACKGROUND: D_D000743 is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of C_D007372 and C_D012254. 
Because of C_D012254-related D_D000743, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy. 
However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of C_D012254 could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or D_D000740-related severe side effects occurred (group B). 
Increased expression and apical targeting of renal EC_D012964C subunits in C_D011692-induced D_D009404 in rats. 
After 7 days, C_D011692 treatment induced significant D_D011507, D_D034141, decreased urinary C_D012964 excretion, and extensive D_D001201. 
After 7 days, C_D011692 treatment induced significant D_D011507, D_D034141, decreased urinary C_D012964 excretion, and extensive D_D001201. 
After 7 days, C_D011692 treatment induced significant D_D011507, D_D034141, decreased urinary C_D012964 excretion, and extensive D_D001201. 
In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of EC_D012964C subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the C_D012964 retention associated with C_D011692-induced D_D009404. 
We have studied the role of C_D009569 and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of D_D009404 induced by a single injection of C_D004317 (C_D004317). 
CONCLUSION: We suggest that interactions between C_D009569 and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the C_D004317-induced D_D009401. 
Therefore, the effects of C_D002354, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on C_D006220-induced D_D002375 in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of C_D011433 and C_D001712, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. 
C_D002354, as well as C_D011433 and C_D001712, inhibited the C_D006220-induced D_D002375. 
These results strongly suggest that C_D002354 improves C_D006220-induced D_D002375 via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of D_D017109 without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic C_D004298 receptor antagonistic activity.

C_D010396-induced rapidly progressive D_D005921 in a patient with D_D001172. 
A 67-year-old woman with D_D001172 presented rapidly progressive D_D005921 (D_D005921) after 5 months of C_D010396 (250 mg/day) treatment. 
This new case of D_D005921 in the course of C_D010396 treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and D_D011507 in these patients.

D_D013923 and other complications of C_D003276 therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of D_D001778 factors: summary report of a ten-year study. 
D_D006323 in a child with D_D002547 undergoing C_C009250 induction of anesthesia after preoperative C_D003000. 
There are no previous reports of C_D003000-associated D_D006323 in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia. 
Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the D_D012640, lethal, locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of C_D003042 in mice. 
In behavioral studies, pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with C_C519696 or (+/-)-C_C107044 significantly attenuated C_D003042-induced D_D012640 and locomotor activity, but not lethality. 
C_D008713-induced D_D041781. 
A 43-year-old woman had severe D_D007565 and D_D011537 1 month after receiving C_D008713 (10 mg tid) and C_D011433 (20 mg tid) for treatment of D_D006980. 
C_D002939-induced acute D_D009395 and D_D000744. 
C_D002939 has been associated with several side effects including D_D009395 and D_D000743. 
C_D002939 has been associated with several side effects including D_D009395 and D_D000743. 
In this report, we describe a case of C_D002939-induced D_D009395 and D_D000744. 
Contribution of C_D014635 to the D_D007177. 
We report the case of a 62-year-old man who was administered C_D014635 (C_D014635) and who subsequently developed the D_D007177 (D_D007177). 
He had been taking C_D014635 for treatment of idiopathic generalized D_D004830 since he was 56 years old. 
We consider this episode of D_D007177 to be the result of a combination of factors including a D_D002493 and the long-term administration of C_D014635. 
C_D014667 in the treatment of C_D020105-induced D_D007022 in severe D_D006333. 
C_D014667 in the treatment of C_D020105-induced D_D007022 in severe D_D006333. 
The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as C_D020105 in the treatment of severe D_D006333 is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and D_D007022. 
In patients with decompensated D_D006333 with D_D007022 after treatment with C_D020105, low doses of C_D014667 restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of C_D020105. 
In patients with decompensated D_D006333 with D_D007022 after treatment with C_D020105, low doses of C_D014667 restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of C_D020105. 
Two halogenated anesthetics, C_D004737 and C_D007530, have been associated with an allergic-type D_D056486 both alone and following previous exposure to C_D006221.

Two halogenated anesthetics, C_D004737 and C_D007530, have been associated with an allergic-type D_D056486 both alone and following previous exposure to C_D006221. 
C_D006221 D_D056486 appears to involve an aberrant immune response. 
An antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (C_D014269 adduct) has been detected on C_D006221 D_D056486 patients. 
This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which C_D004737 and/or C_D007530 could produce a D_D004342 condition similar to that of C_D006221 D_D056486 either alone or subsequent to C_D006221 administration.

D_D010212 of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all C_D000082-treated groups, and three rats bore D_D001749. 
Additionally, 20 to 25% of C_D000082-treated rats developed D_D006965 of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of D_D001744. 
An electron microscope study of the livers of C_D000082-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known D_D008113. 
In addition to D_D009135, severe damage was also seen in harderian glands, especially after exposure to C_D008619 and C_D008012 plus C_D004837. 
In addition to D_D009135, severe damage was also seen in harderian glands, especially after exposure to C_D008619 and C_D008012 plus C_D004837. 
The novel anxiolytic drug, C_D002065, reverses D_D002375 induced by C_D006220. 
A series of C_-1 analogues of C_D002065 and other C_D058825 were tested for their ability to reverse C_D006220 induced D_D002375. 
C_D003975 facilitates reflex D_D001919 in conscious rats. 
Also, reflex D_D001919 was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of C_D004837 (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1). 
Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with C_D003975, although causing no change in the C_D004837-induced pressor effect, did enhance the C_D004837-induced reflex D_D001919. 
Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with C_D003975, although causing no change in the C_D004837-induced pressor effect, did enhance the C_D004837-induced reflex D_D001919. 
However, the C_D003975 enhancement of C_D004837-induced reflex D_D001919 was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of C_D010852 (an agent blocks C_D002712 channels by binding to sites associated with the C_D001569-C_D005680-C_D002712 channel macromolecular complex). 
However, the C_D003975 enhancement of C_D004837-induced reflex D_D001919 was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of C_D010852 (an agent blocks C_D002712 channels by binding to sites associated with the C_D001569-C_D005680-C_D002712 channel macromolecular complex). 
The data indicate that C_D003975 acts through the C_D001569-C_D005680-C_D002712 channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex D_D001919 mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure. 
Chronic C_D002220 inhibits the development of local anesthetic D_D012640 kindled by C_D003042 and C_D008012. 
Chronic C_D002220 inhibits the development of local anesthetic D_D012640 kindled by C_D003042 and C_D008012. 
Chronic oral C_D002220 inhibited the development of both C_D008012- and C_D003042-induced D_D012640, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic D_D012640. 
Chronic oral C_D002220 inhibited the development of both C_D008012- and C_D003042-induced D_D012640, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic D_D012640. 
Chronic C_D002220 also decreased the incidence of D_D012640-related mortality in the C_D003042-injected rats. 
Acute C_D002220 over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed C_D008012-kindled or acute C_D003042-induced D_D012640. 
Acute C_D002220 over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed C_D008012-kindled or acute C_D003042-induced D_D012640. 
Repeated i.p. injection of C_D002220 (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of C_D008012- or C_D003042-kindled D_D012640. 
Repeated i.p. injection of C_D002220 (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of C_D008012- or C_D003042-kindled D_D012640. 
C_D010396 caused D_D009404 in 1 patient and milder reversible D_D011507 in 3 other patients; none developed D_D051437. 
C_D010396 caused D_D009404 in 1 patient and milder reversible D_D011507 in 3 other patients; none developed D_D051437. 
Preservation of renal blood flow during D_D007022 induced with C_D018818 in dogs. 
The hypothesis that C_D018818 could be used to induce D_D007022 and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested. 
Renal blood flow (RBF) increased during C_D018818-induced D_D007022 11 +/- 7 per cent and decreased 21 +/- 8 per cent during C_D012964 C_D009599-induced D_D007022 (P less than 0.01). 
Renal blood flow (RBF) increased during C_D018818-induced D_D007022 11 +/- 7 per cent and decreased 21 +/- 8 per cent during C_D012964 C_D009599-induced D_D007022 (P less than 0.01). 
Sodium C_D009599 is a non-selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced D_D007022. 
C_D004070 D_D001145, which is suppressed by C_D012964 channel blockers, was induced by intermittent intravenous (i.v.) injection of C_D010042 in C_D010424-anesthetized dogs. 
Adrenaline D_D001145, which is suppressed by C_D002118 channel blockers, was induced by C_D004837 infusion in C_D006221-anesthetized dogs. 
Ten and 5 mg/kg i.v. (+)-C_C032151 suppressed C_D004070- and C_D004837-induced D_D001145s, respectively. 
The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (+)-C_C032151 for C_D004070- and C_D004837-induced D_D001145s were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). 
A lower dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. of (-)-C_C032151 suppressed the C_D004070-induced D_D001145, whereas 5 mg/kg i.v. was needed to suppress C_D004837-induced D_D001145s. 
The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (-)-C_C032151 for C_D004070- and C_D004837-induced D_D001145 were 0.06 +/- 0.04 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). 
Effect of methanolic extract of C_D010936 (100-300 mg/kg) was studied on C_D012110-induced orofacial D_D004409 and neurochemical alterations. 
The results of the present study suggested that C_D010936 had a protective role against C_D012110-induced orofacial D_D004409 and oxidative stress. 
C_D005472-induced D_D054549: a case report. 
Reduction of D_D010146 during induction with target-controlled C_D015742 and C_C071741. 
BACKGROUND: D_D010146 on injection of C_D015742 is unpleasant. 
We hypothesized that C_D015742 infusion D_D010146 might be prevented by infusing C_C071741 before starting the C_D015742 infusion in a clinical setting where target-controlled infusions (TCI) of both drugs were used. 
C_C071741-related complications were assessed during the C_C071741 infusion, and D_D010146 caused by C_D015742 was evaluated using a four-point scale during the C_D015742 infusion. 
CONCLUSIONS: During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of C_D015742 and C_C071741, a significant reduction in C_D015742 infusion D_D010146 was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of C_C071741 at a target Ce of 4 ng ml(-1). 
Prenatal exposure to C_D005473 induces fetal D_D006976 in the rat. 
Epidemiological data suggest that C_D005473 exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent D_D006976 of the newborn. 
The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a D_D006976 protective C_D005473 effect in adult rodents. 
As compared with controls, C_D005473 exposure resulted in fetal D_D006976 as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the adult, C_D005473 exposure in utero induces D_D006976 in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation. 
D_D013575 and D_D008133 among patients treated with C_D008691 for C_D003932 dependence in the city of Copenhagen. 
D_D013575 and D_D008133 among patients treated with C_D008691 for C_D003932 dependence in the city of Copenhagen. 
As C_D003932 addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of D_D013575 to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of D_D016171 in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of C_D008691. 
The association between opioid dose and QT, and C_D008691 dose and reporting of D_D013575 was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. 
Among the subjects treated with C_D008691, 28% men and 32% women had D_D008133. 
A 50 mg higher C_D008691 dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for D_D013575. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D008691 is associated with D_D008133 and higher reporting of D_D013575 in a population of C_D003932 addicts. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D008691 is associated with D_D008133 and higher reporting of D_D013575 in a population of C_D003932 addicts. 
D_D010523 caused by high-dose C_D003561 treatment in a patient with D_D015470. 
Although the mechanisms of D_D010523 are still unclear, high-dose C_D003561 is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms. 
C_C065179 prevented and reversed C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in the rat. 
To assess the antioxidant effects of C_C065179 (C_C065179) on C_D003907 (C_D003907)-induced D_D006973, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with C_C065179 30 mg/kg/day or tap water for 15 days. 
C_C065179 reversed C_D003907-induced D_D006973 (129 +/- 0.6 mmHg, vs. 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg P' < 0.05) and decreased plasma C_D013481 (7931 +/- 392.8 C_D003907, 1187 +/- 441.2 C_C065179 + C_D003907, P < 0.0001). 
Thus, C_C065179 prevented and reversed C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in the rat. 
Their ester prodrugs 6 and 8 were orally active in three models of D_D010146: reversal of C_D005557-induced paw licking, C_D002351-induced D_D006930, and C_D002211-induced D_D006930.

Two recently available immunosuppressive agents, C_C063008 and C_D020123 (C_D020123), have no D_D007674. 
D_D000740 was induced using a single dose of C_D016190 (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration. 
In a second group, the development of D_D000740 was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before C_D016190 application. 
The role of nitrergic system in C_D008012-induced D_D012640 in the mouse. 
The effects of C_D019331 (C_D019331) a C_D009569 (C_D009569) synthase inhibitor and C_D001120, a C_D009569 precursor, were investigated on C_D008012-induced D_D012640s. 
C_D019331 (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and C_D003975 (2 mg/kg) significantly decreased the incidence of C_D008012 (50 mg/kg)-induced D_D012640s. 
In contrast, the C_D001120 treatment increased the incidence of C_D008012 (80 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced D_D012640s significantly. 
These results may suggest that C_D009569 is a proconvulsant mediator in C_D008012-induced D_D012640s. 
Effect of intravenous C_D008790 or intravenous C_D008790 plus glucagon on C_D004280-induced D_D017202. 
CONCLUSION: During C_D004280 stress testing, C_D008790 attenuates or eliminates evidence of D_D017202. 
C_D011239-induced D_D018908 is caused more by D_D001284 than by altered C_D000109 receptor expression. 
Rapid reversal of life-threatening C_D004110-induced D_D013746 with C_D002122. 
We describe a patient who developed D_D013746 with sudden D_D012131 after the infusion of intravenous C_D004110. 
The emergency physician should be aware that life-threatening D_D013746 may accompany the administration of intravenous C_D004110 and that C_D002122 may be a rapid and effective remedy. 
Maximal D_D001791 induced by 6 microM of C_D000244 decreased after administration of C_D007660. 
One patient in the C_D007660 group developed a postoperative intracranial D_D006406. 
Value of C_D008775 in prevention of the D_D018771-D_D063806 syndrome associated with the total dose infusion of C_D007505: a double blind randomized trial. 
A case of D_D017285 in a patient with D_D008105 treated with C_D010396. 
D_D017285/D_D003882 can develop as one of the autoimmune complications of C_D010396 treatment, but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear. 
We report a patient with D_D008105, who developed D_D017285 while receiving C_D010396 therapy. 
Patients receiving C_D010396 therapy should be followed carefully for the development of autoimmune complications like D_D017285/D_D003882. 
Photodistributed C_D009543-induced facial D_D013684. 
Five months after starting C_D009543 (C_D009543), two patients developed photodistributed facial D_D013684, which became more noticeable with time. 
One commenced the closely related drug C_D017311 3 years later, with recurrence of D_D013684. 
D_D007674 of C_D016572 and C_D016559: inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase. 
D_D007674 of C_D016572 and C_D016559: inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase. 
These results suggest that the D_D007674 effects of C_D016572 and C_D016559 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.

Massive D_D001929 associated with fulminant D_D017093 in C_D000082 D_D062787: possible role of cranial decompression. 
Massive D_D001929 associated with fulminant D_D017093 in C_D000082 D_D062787: possible role of cranial decompression. 
We present a patient with fatal C_D000082-induced fulminant D_D017093, with signs and symptoms of D_D001929, unresponsive to conventional medical therapy. 
We present a patient with fatal C_D000082-induced fulminant D_D017093, with signs and symptoms of D_D001929, unresponsive to conventional medical therapy. 
C_D005839 D_D007674 in a neonate. 
The clinical and autopsy findings in a premature baby who died of D_D058186 after therapy with C_D005839 (5 mg/kg/day) and C_D010406 are presented. 
After the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced PAS positive D_D011230 was significantly reduced when C_D010634 was given simultaneously with C_D004052 for 4 and 6 weeks. 
Post-operative D_D009127 after C_D005283 administration. 
A case of thoraco-abdominal D_D009127 leading to D_D012131 is described in the post-operative period in an elderly patient who received a moderate dose of C_D005283. 
A case of thoraco-abdominal D_D009127 leading to D_D012131 is described in the post-operative period in an elderly patient who received a moderate dose of C_D005283. 
Postpartum D_D011605 induced by C_D001971. 
Two multigravida patients with no prior D_D001523 history were seen with postpartum D_D011605, having received C_D001971 for D_D007775. 
C_D001971 given in high doses has been associated with D_D011605 in patients receiving the drug for D_D010300. 
These cases demonstrate that C_D001971 may cause D_D011605 even when given in low doses. 
Since 1975 C_D016685 (C_D016685) has been suggested to be D_D066126, especially when combined with or given following C_D004317. 
One of the patients developed D_D006333 after 30 mg m-2 C_D016685 and only 150 mg m-2 C_D004317. 
One of the patients developed D_D006333 after 30 mg m-2 C_D016685 and only 150 mg m-2 C_D004317. 
Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that C_D016685-related D_D066126 is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with C_D004317. 
C_D010695-induced D_D006029 does not prevent C_D005839 D_D007674 in rats. 
Because rats with C_D013311-induced D_D003920 (D_D003920) have a high solute diuresis (D_D006029 of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to C_D005839-induced D_D058186 (D_D058186). 
Because rats with C_D013311-induced D_D003920 (D_D003920) have a high solute diuresis (D_D006029 of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to C_D005839-induced D_D058186 (D_D058186). 
The protection from C_D005839 D_D007674 was studied in non-D_D003920 rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular C_D005947 reabsorption with C_D010695 (C_D010695). 
D_D007674 doses (40 mg/kg body wt/day) of C_D005839 were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV. 
In Group II, C_D010695 did not prevent C_D005839-D_D058186 (maximal decrease in CCr at day 9.89%, C_D010695 less than 0.001; peak lysozymuria, 1863 +/- 321 micrograms/day; and D_D009956 score, 3.9 +/- 0.1). 
C_D063325 in C_D007980-induced D_D004409. 
C_D063325, a substituted C_C037689 derivative closely related to C_D008787, reduced C_D007980-induced peak dose D_D004409 in 16 patients with D_D010300. 
C_D063325, a substituted C_C037689 derivative closely related to C_D008787, reduced C_D007980-induced peak dose D_D004409 in 16 patients with D_D010300. 
C_D063325 had no effect on C_D007980-induced early morning of "off-period" segmental D_D004421. 
These results fail to support the notion that C_D007980-induced D_D004409 are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of C_D004298 receptors. 
C_D007649 elicited D_D011605 like psychopathology. 
C_D004298 is not essential for the development of C_D008694-induced D_D020258. 
Here we show that the recently reported ability of C_D007980 to reverse the protective effect of C_D019805 on C_D008694-induced C_D004298 D_D020258 is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature. 
Further, we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain C_D004298 develop C_D008694 D_D020258, as long as the thermic effects of C_D008694 are preserved. 
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that C_D004298 is not essential for the development of C_D008694-induced C_D004298rgic D_D020258 and suggest that mechanisms independent of C_D004298 warrant more intense investigation. 
We report on an infant with D_D003389 attributable to D_-1, born to a C_D003042-addicted mother. 
The protective role of Nrf2 in C_D013311-induced D_D003928. 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against D_D003928 using human kidney biopsy tissues from D_D003928 patients, a C_D013311-induced D_D003928 model in Nrf2(-/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells. 
High-dose C_D014148 is associated with nonischemic clinical D_D012640 in cardiac surgical patients. 
The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between C_D014148 usage and D_D012640 after cardiac surgery. 
All 24 patients with D_D012640 received high doses of C_D014148 intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures. 
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high-dose C_D014148 in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical D_D012640 in susceptible patients. 
Recurrent D_D000857 induced by C_D011718. 
We report a case of reversible D_D000857 related to C_D011718 in a woman, with a positive rechallenge. 
D_D000857 disappeared completely after C_D011718 withdrawal and recurred after its rechallenge. 
There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the C_D000518 plus C_D013467 group who experienced clinically significant D_D034381 compared with the placebo group. 
Increased D_D003072 associated with the APOE epsilon4 allele after C_D014282 oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly. 
RESULTS: A 2.0-mg oral dose of C_D014282 resulted in increased subjective ratings of D_D003072 in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only. 
Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2.0 mg C_D014282 and placebo on ratings of D_D003072 significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only. 
CONCLUSION: The epsilon4 allele in healthy elderly was associated with increased subjective D_D003072 after C_D014282 anticholinergic challenge. 
C_D013739 alone had no effect on locomotion, D_D001523, or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and D_D001523. 
Six of the patients received more than 15 mg C_D017239 and suffered from moderate to severe D_D001929, while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg C_D017239. 
C_D008774-induced D_D009771 in an elderly man. 
Significant D_D009771 ensued but diminished over several weeks when C_D008774 was replaced by C_D016666. 
D_D006323 after intravenous C_D008787 - a case of five repeated injections of C_D008787 causing five episodes of D_D006323. 
We describe a patient where intravenous injection of C_D008787 was immediately followed by D_D006323 repeatedly. 
After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation, it is clear that every administration of C_D008787 was immediately (within s) followed by D_D006323. 
We interpret this as episodes of D_D006323 caused by C_D008787. 
Severe immune D_D000743 associated with prophylactic use of C_D015313 in obstetric and gynecologic procedures. 
Second- and third-generation C_D002511, especially C_D015313, are increasingly associated with severe, sometimes fatal immune D_D000743. 
We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of C_D015313-induced D_D000743s were in patients who had received C_D015313 prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures. 
D_D011128 after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% C_D008012: a review of six cases of D_D011128 reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993-1997. 
Cortical motor overactivation in D_D020734 patients with C_D007980-induced peak-dose D_D004409. 
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of D_D020734 patients on C_D007980 medication, the first one without C_D007980 induced D_D004409 (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose D_D004409 (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects. 
These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an D_D006948 D_D004409, like C_D007980-induced peak dose D_D004409, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop. 
C_D003907-induced D_D009798 in perfusion-cultured human eyes. 
In contrast, the C_D003907-treated D_D009798 had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm. 
CONCLUSION: C_D003907 treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of D_D009798 in approximately 30% of the C_D003907-treated eyes. 
D_D003072 from long-term abuse of C_D003915: a case report. 
This report describes a case of D_D003072 resulting from prolonged use of C_D003915. 
Complete D_D006327 following a single dose of C_D014196. 
Forty minutes after receiving a single starting dose of C_D014196, a patient developed complete D_D006327. 
C_C033457-induced fulminant D_D056486 in a pregnant woman. 
We report the case of a 19-year-old Laotian patient affected by fulminant D_D056486 during the third trimester of her pregnancy after a 1-month administration of C_C033457. 
C_D011802 itself or C_C033457 may be responsible for fulminant D_D056486 in this patient. 
C_D011802 itself or C_C033457 may be responsible for fulminant D_D056486 in this patient. 
The epidemiology of the acute D_D021501 syndrome from C_D013496. 
D_D006463 associated with ingestion of C_D011803. 
D_D006463 following C_D011803 ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature. 
C_D011803-associated D_D006463 probably occurs more often than is recognized. 
Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and D_D006528 of mice induced by C_D001556. 
Peroxisomes in D_D006528s and hyperplastic preneoplastic D_D017093 induced in mice by 500 ppm C_D001556 were examined histochemically and electron microscopically. 
C_D011802 D_D056486. 
We concluded that this patient had C_D011802 D_D056486 and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation. 
In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, C_C013440, C_-1 (C_-1) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the D_D056486 effects of C_D002251 (C_D002251). 
A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of C_-1 (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the D_D056486 effects of C_D002251, C_D002725, C_D000082 and C_D005688 and against the lethal (and presumably D_D066126) effect of C_D004317 administration.

The mechanism of C_-1 protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against C_D005688 D_D056486ity). 
D_D018366 associated with C_D010068. 
A 67-year-old man who was treated with C_D010068 for one week because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, developed D_D051437 and diffuse, symmetric, palpable D_D011693 on his feet. 
C_D010068 should be included among the drugs that can cause D_D018366. 
Pretreatment with C_C024224 significantly blocked C_D009020 D_D000699, D_D002375 and D_D007035 at a dose which completely eliminated high-affinity binding in brain membranes.

Moreover, C_C024224 significantly attenuated the C_D009020-induced D_D007022 and D_D012131, whereas C_D009020-induced D_D001919 was less affected.

PURPOSE: The C_D018943 C_D003630 and C_D004317 and the C_D011034 C_D005047 are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, D_D001855 and D_D066126 limit their use. 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the D_D006402 following coadministration of C_D064730 and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to C_D005047, C_D003630, and C_D004317 +/- C_D064730 was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays.

RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of C_D064730 reduced D_D001855 and D_D015431 from C_D003630 and C_D005047 in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, C_D064730 neither reduced D_D001855, D_D015431, nor the in vitro D_D064420 from C_D004317.

Clinical trials in patients with brain D_D009362 combining C_D064730 and high doses of C_D005047 is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating D_D006402. 
The effect of C_C036466 (C_C036466, C_C036466) was studied on various forms of experimentally D_D003072 (learning and memory) in rodents and produced the following effects: (1) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal D_D006935 immediately before the acquisition session; (2) partial (rats) or complete (mice) prevention of the C_D012601-induced short-term D_D000647 for a passive avoidance task; (3) complete protection against D_D000647 for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition; (4) prevention of the long-term retention- or retrieval-deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by C_D002701 or C_D003513 administered immediately after acquisition; (5) reversal, when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test, of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by C_D003513 injected 2 days previously; (6) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or D_D006935 applied immediately before retrieval testing (24 h after acquisition).

C_D009538 potentiation of C_D009020-induced D_D002375 in mice. 
C_D009538 potentiation of C_D009020-induced D_D002375 in mice. 
In the present study, effects of C_D009538 on D_D002375 induced by C_D009020 in mice have been investigated. 
In the present study, effects of C_D009538 on D_D002375 induced by C_D009020 in mice have been investigated. 
C_D009020 but not C_D009538 induced a dose-dependent D_D002375. 
C_D009020 but not C_D009538 induced a dose-dependent D_D002375. 
Intraperitoneal administration of C_D001285, C_D009270, C_D008464, and C_D018738 to mice reduced D_D002375 induced by a combination of C_D009020 with C_D009538. 
Intraperitoneal administration of C_D001285, C_D009270, C_D008464, and C_D018738 to mice reduced D_D002375 induced by a combination of C_D009020 with C_D009538. 
Intracerebroventricular injection of C_D001285, C_D018738, and C_D009270 also decreased D_D002375 induced by C_D009020 plus C_D009538. 
Intracerebroventricular injection of C_D001285, C_D018738, and C_D009270 also decreased D_D002375 induced by C_D009020 plus C_D009538. 
It was concluded that C_D009020 D_D002375 can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors, and the potentiation of C_D009020 induced by C_D009538 may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms.

Reduced D_D066126 and preserved antiD_D009369 efficacy of liposome-encapsulated C_D004317 and C_D003520 compared with conventional C_D004317 and C_D003520 in a randomized, multicenter trial of metastatic D_D001943. 
PURPOSE: To determine whether C_D004317 (liposome-encapsulated C_D004317; The Liposome Company, Elan Corporation, Princeton, NJ) in combination with C_D003520 significantly reduces C_D004317 D_D066126 while providing comparable antiD_D009369 efficacy in first-line treatment of metastatic D_D001943 (D_D001943). 
CONCLUSION: C_D004317 improves the therapeutic index of C_D004317 by significantly reducing D_D066126 and grade 4 D_D009503 and provides comparable antiD_D009369 efficacy, when used in combination with C_D003520 as first-line therapy for D_D001943.

C_C034753 reverses C_D015215-induced D_D001855 without impairment of anti-human D_D007153 virus activity. 
Because of the clinical D_D064420 associated with chronic C_D014529 administration, the ability of benzylacycloC_D014529 (C_C034753) to effect, in vivo, C_D015215-induced D_D000740 and D_D007970 was assessed.

C_D003520-induced D_D003556 in freely-moving conscious rats: behavioral approach to a new model of D_D059265. 
C_D003520 (C_D003520), an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite C_D000171, was used to induce D_D003556. 
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that this experimental model of C_D003520-induced D_D003556 may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory D_D059265, allowing a better understanding of these D_D010146 and thus a better therapeutic approach to them.

D_D006930 and D_D009207 in terminal D_D009369 patients treated with continuous intravenous C_D009020. 
D_D006930 and D_D009207 in terminal D_D009369 patients treated with continuous intravenous C_D009020. 
Eight D_D009369 patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous C_D009020 developed D_D006930. 
Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between D_D006930/D_D009207 and high doses of C_D009020 are available, experimental support from animal studies indicates that C_D009020, or its metabolites, plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome. 
D_D013924 occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; D_D007674 and D_D006311 were confined to patients receiving an C_D000617 plus C_D014640.

C_D014212-induced D_D004893 in patients with D_D015473. 
D_D004893 associated with C_D014212 (C_D014212) for D_D015473 (D_D015473) is very rare. 
We describe four patients with classic D_D015473 who developed D_D004893 during C_D014212 therapy. 
D_D005334 and subsequent multiple D_D010146 D_D004893 over extremities developed on D11, D16, D17, and D19, respectively, after C_D014212 therapy. 
D_D005334 and subsequent multiple D_D010146 D_D004893 over extremities developed on D11, D16, D17, and D19, respectively, after C_D014212 therapy. 
C_D014212 seemed to be the most possible etiology of D_D004893 in our patients. 
Short-term use of C_D013256 is very effective in C_D014212-induced D_D004893. 
Delayed-onset C_D006493-induced D_D013921. 
BACKGROUND: C_D006493-induced D_D013921 presents 5 to 12 days after C_D006493 exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. 
Delayed recognition and treatment of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 contribute to poor patient outcomes. 
OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 are delayed. 
PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom C_D006493-induced D_D013921 became apparent on delayed presentation with D_D013923 complications. 
PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom C_D006493-induced D_D013921 became apparent on delayed presentation with D_D013923 complications. 
MEASUREMENTS: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined D_D013923, results of C_D006493-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes. 
RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included C_D006493 exposure--in most cases, with no D_D013921 recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with D_D013923 complications.

CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-onset C_D006493-induced D_D013921 is increasingly being recognized. 
To avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider C_D006493-induced D_D013921 whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with D_D013923; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not C_D006493, should be initiated.

Oral administration of C_C081198 (2.5, 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the D_D002375 responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an C_D000241 A2A receptor agonist, C_C061282 (10 micrograms), in a dose-dependent manner. 
C_C081198 also reduced the D_D002375 induced by C_D006220 (1 mg/kg i.p.) and by C_D012110 (5 mg/kg i.p.).

This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to C_D000638-induced D_D007037 in a patient with severe D_D006333 (D_D006333). 
Patients with D_D006333 on C_D000638 may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from D_D007037, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. 
Furthermore, C_D015016 increased baseline D_D012021 amplitude in the LES, while C_C015068 suppressed baseline D_D012021 in both the LES and FPS and C_D010433 suppressed baseline D_D012021 in the FPS.

A 59-year-old woman with D_D003093 developed D_D005128, D_D010996, D_D004802 and D_D001745 after restarting of C_D012460 treatment. 
Although cessation of C_D012460 treatment resulted in improvements in D_D005334, D_D005128, D_D002637, titer of C-reactive protein and volume of the D_D010996s, we initiated C_D013256 therapy, because PR3-ANCA titer rose to 320 EU, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the D_D010996 remained.

C_C012052 related D_D013981 in an adolescent D_D012559. 
The D_D013981 resolved completely after we reduced the dose of C_C012052 down to 800 mg per day. 
Together with previously reported cases, our patient suggests that D_D013981 might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as C_C069541, C_D003024, or C_C012052. 
C_D001241 (C_D001241 [C_D001241]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces D_D000014 when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11 (Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ. 
Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when C_D001241 is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal D_D005767 confounds the detection of low incidence D_D000014 with C_D001241 when a multiple dosing paradigm is used. 
RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce D_D006345 (D_D006345) and D_D009436 (D_D009436) in rats and D_D065630 (D_D065630), D_D009436, and D_D006345 in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these D_D000014, even though C_D001241 induces several other low-incidence D_D000014. 
RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce D_D006345 (D_D006345) and D_D009436 (D_D009436) in rats and D_D065630 (D_D065630), D_D009436, and D_D006345 in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these D_D000014, even though C_D001241 induces several other low-incidence D_D000014.

Variations and D_D000014 were similar when C_D001241 was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). 
It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, D_D000014 that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with C_D001241 given at multiple doses. 
D_D016171 induced by C_D008787 in an elderly woman with preexisting complete D_D002037. 
We report on a 92-year-old woman with preexisting complete D_D002037 who developed D_D016171 after intravenous and oral administration of C_D008787. 
This patient also developed D_D016171 when C_D020117 and C_D004917 were given simultaneously. 
This patient also developed D_D016171 when C_D020117 and C_D004917 were given simultaneously. 
This is the first documentation that C_D008787 provokes D_D016171 clinically. 
C_D008787 should be used cautiously in patients with a risk of D_D016171. 
In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous C_D001058 infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting C_D007980-induced D_D004409. 
In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous C_D001058 infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting C_D007980-induced D_D004409. 
The main side effects of subcutaneous C_D001058 treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and D_D001523 complications play a lesser role. 
Fatal excited D_D003693 following C_D003042 use: epidemiologic findings provide new evidence for mechanisms of C_D003042 D_D064420. 
We describe an outbreak of deaths from C_D003042-induced excited D_D003693 (D_D003693) in Dade County, Florida between 1979 and 1990. 
From a registry of all C_D003042-related deaths in Dade County, Florida, from 1969-1990, 58 D_D003693 were compared with 125 victims of accidental C_D003042 D_D062787 without excited D_D003693. 
D_D003693 had concentrations of C_D003042 and C_C005618 in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls. 
The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic C_D003042 use disrupts dopaminergic function and, when coupled with recent C_D003042 use, may precipitate D_D011595, D_D003693, aberrant thermoregulation, D_D012206, and D_D003645.

We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent-onset D_D001281, who experienced an acute devastating D_D017116 a few minutes after initiation of intravenous C_D000638 loading. 
D_D010149 after C_D013390: no evidence for an inflammatory origin. 
A common side effect associated with C_D013390 is D_D010149. 
The incidence and severity of C_D013390-associated D_D063806 was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or C_D003907 before C_D013390 (n = 32 for each). 
In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of C_D013390-associated D_D063806. 
IMPLICATIONS: Administration of C_D003907 before C_D013390 was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of C_D013390-induced D_D010149. 
Pretreatment with C_D003907 is not justified to prevent D_D010149 after C_D013390. 
C_D007980-induced oromandibular D_D004421 in D_D013494. 
C_D007980-induced D_D004409 have been reported in D_D010300 and D_D019578. 
In this report we describe an unusual case of reversible C_D007980-induced Oromandibular D_D004421 (D_D008538) in a D_D013494 patient to highlight the importance of recognizing this drug related complication in the management of D_D013494, and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiology. 
Protective effect of C_C005435 against C_D013307-induced D_D015837 in the guinea pig. 
This study investigated alleviation of C_D013307-induced D_D015837 by C_C005435 in guinea pigs. 
These results suggest that C_C005435 suppresses C_D013307-induced D_D015837. 
C_D003975, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to C_D007649 as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative D_D006212. 
The memory-enhancing effects of C_C018370 and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of C_D012601-induced D_D000647. 
Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural C_C018370 to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing C_D012601-induced D_D000647. 
Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and D_D010146 ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of D_D006930 and D_D006930 after intradermal C_D002211 injection were determined. 
Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and D_D010146 ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of D_D006930 and D_D006930 after intradermal C_D002211 injection were determined. 
RESULTS: C_D000241 produced no effect on D_D010146 report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced D_D006930 and D_D006930 from intradermal C_D002211 injection for at least 24 h. 
RESULTS: C_D000241 produced no effect on D_D010146 report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced D_D006930 and D_D006930 from intradermal C_D002211 injection for at least 24 h. 
All patients having first-degree relatives affected by D_D013959 had accelerated onset of D_D007037ism (3.7 years after onset of C_D008094 therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of C_D008094 therapy). 
CONCLUSIONS: Familial D_D013959 is a risk factor for D_D007037ism and D_D006934 during C_D008094 therapy. 
Systemic D_D064420 following administration of C_D020123 (formerly C_D020123) for D_D011565: association of D_D019559 with apoptosis of lesional lymphocytes. 
After 2 individuals with D_D011565 developed a D_D019559 following treatment with oral C_D020123 lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis. 
OBSERVATIONS: A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with C_D020123-induced D_D019559 had a 2.3-fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells (to 48%) compared with an unaffected C_D020123-treated patient with D_D011565 (21%). 
CONCLUSIONS: Severe adverse effects of C_D020123 include D_D005334, D_D000740, and D_D019559. 
D_D009127 was induced by C_D006220 (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). 
C_C066192 (C_C066192), a selective C_D005998 site antagonist, injected in doses of 2.5 and 4.5 microg/0.5 microl bilaterally, into the rostral region of the striatum, decreased both the C_D006220-induced D_D009127 (MMG) and the enhanced electromyographic activity (EMG). 
D_D009135, defined as muscle symptoms with C_D003401 kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of C_D008148 (80 mg). 
The effects of D_D012892 (D_D012892) on C_D001058-induced D_D001523 and C_D011814-induced D_D009069 in rats were determined. 
The effects of D_D012892 (D_D012892) on C_D001058-induced D_D001523 and C_D011814-induced D_D009069 in rats were determined. 
Forty-eight hr of D_D012892 increased C_D001058-induced D_D001523, and reduced (immediately after completing of D_D012892) or increased (96 hr after completing of D_D012892) C_D011814-induced D_D009069. 
Forty-eight hr of D_D012892 increased C_D001058-induced D_D001523, and reduced (immediately after completing of D_D012892) or increased (96 hr after completing of D_D012892) C_D011814-induced D_D009069. 
The incidence of D_D010302 was higher at higher doses of C_D006220 and in younger patients. 
D_D006504 caused by C_D013866. 
Clinically reversible D_D006504 developed in a 23-year-old man with D_D054198 after 10 months of maintenance therapy with C_D013866. 
This case presented a unique opportunity to observe the histologic features of clinically reversible D_D006504 over time, and may be the first case of veno-occlusive related solely to C_D013866. 
Treatment of C_D007069-induced D_D001745 by oral administration of C_D015080 (C_D015080) to patients with inoperable D_D008175. 
The protective effect of oral administration of the C_D013438 compound C_D015080 (C_D015080) against D_D001745 induced by C_D007069 (C_D007069) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable D_D008175 under treatment with C_D007069 (2250 mg/m2 on days 2-5) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4-week cycle. 
C_D015080 was given orally on the days of treatment with C_D007069 in 3 doses of 840 mg/m2, each administered at 0 hr (= injection of C_D007069), 4 hr and 8 hr p.i. Out of a total of 88 courses of this treatment we observed 10 episodes of asymptomatic microscopic D_D006417 and no episodes of gross D_D006417. 
Production of autochthonous D_D011471 in Lobund-Wistar rats by treatments with C_D008770 and C_D013739. 
Production of autochthonous D_D011471 in Lobund-Wistar rats by treatments with C_D008770 and C_D013739. 
More than 50% of Lobund-Wistar (L-W) strain rats developed large, palpable D_D011471 (D_D011471) following treatments with C_D008770 (CAS: 684-93-5) and C_D013739 propionate [(C_D043343) CAS: 57-85-2], and most of the D_D009369-bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions. 
More than 50% of Lobund-Wistar (L-W) strain rats developed large, palpable D_D011471 (D_D011471) following treatments with C_D008770 (CAS: 684-93-5) and C_D013739 propionate [(C_D043343) CAS: 57-85-2], and most of the D_D009369-bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions. 
More than 50% of Lobund-Wistar (L-W) strain rats developed large, palpable D_D011471 (D_D011471) following treatments with C_D008770 (CAS: 684-93-5) and C_D013739 propionate [(C_D043343) CAS: 57-85-2], and most of the D_D009369-bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions. 
Within the same timeframe, no L-W rat developed a similar palpable D_D011471 when treated only with C_D043343. 
In L-W rats, C_D043343 acted as a D_D009369 enhancement agent, with primary emphasis on the development of D_D011471. 
A D_D004421-like syndrome after neuropeptide (C_D009074/C_D000324) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus. 
In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with C_D020927 prevents the D_D009127 caused by high-dose C_D015760 anesthesia in the rat. 
In contrast, C_D020927 prevented C_D015760-induced D_D009127 in a dose-dependent fashion. 
The ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by C_D013311-induced D_D003920. 
The effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in C_D013311-D_D003920 rats were investigated. 
The data indicate that the effects of C_D013311-induced D_D003920 on urinary bladder function are both prevented and reversed by insulin treatment. 
The data indicate that C_D010656-induced D_D006973 instituted 2 h after D_D020244 does not aggravate D_D004487 in the D_D007511 core, that it improves D_D004487 in the periphery of the D_D007511 territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical D_D009410. 
C_D000638 D_D008171. 
C_D000638 is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side-effects, the most problematic being D_D011014. 
The D_D008171 of C_D000638 is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell-mediated hypersensitivity D_D011014. 
The D_D008171 of C_D000638 is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell-mediated hypersensitivity D_D011014. 
The clinical and radiographic features of C_D000638-induced D_D008171 are characteristic but nonspecific. 
Light chain D_D011507 and cellular mediated immunity in C_D012293 treated patients with D_D014376. 
Light chain D_D011507 was found in 9 of 17 D_D014376 patients treated with C_D012293. 
Initial C_D011188 loss and D_D007008 during C_D002752 administration in patients with essential D_D006973: the influence of dietary C_D012964 restriction. 
In this study we postulated that during D_D058186 induced by C_D005839 the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels. 
C_D010121 is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal D_D007022, particularly when given as a bolus. 
C_D010121-induced D_D007022 at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to D_D006473. 
D_D007022 in response to C_D010121 was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in D_D020521 volume, heart rate and cardiac output. 
Exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout (VIP-/-) mice with C_D003520 (C_D003520)-induced D_D003556. 
VIP(-/-) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after C_D003520 (C_D003520)-induced D_D003556. 
A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type (WT) and VIP(-/-) mice with or without C_D003520-induced D_D003556 (150 mg/kg; i.p.; 48 h). 
OBJECTIVE: To report the incidence and management of D_D009798 (IOP) in patients with D_D014605 treated with the C_D005446 (C_D005446) intravitreal implant. 
Pallidal stimulation improves D_D018476 and D_D009127 to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving C_D007980-induced D_D004409. 
Case report: C_D010665 (C_D010665) as a cause of D_D009203. 
C_D018967-associated, benign transient D_D010468 in D_D012559 patients with a past history of C_D008238 abuse. 
Two D_D012559 patients, who had a prior history of C_D008238 abuse and who had previously developed D_D001480 with classic antipsychotics, were successfully treated with C_D018967. 
They both reported short episodes of transient D_D010468, which appeared immediately after starting treatment with C_D018967. 
C_D018967 administration was continued and the D_D010468 gradually wore off. 
Activation of C_D011064 polymerase contributes to development of C_D004317-induced D_D006333. 
Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the D_D066126 of C_D004317 (C_D004317), a widely used antitumor C_D018943 antibiotic. 
Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the C_D004317-induced D_D066126. 
Using a dual approach of PARP-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor C_C434926, we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of D_D006331 induced by C_D004317. 
Thus, PARP activation contributes to the D_D066126 of C_D004317. 
C_D015725-induced D_D016171. 
OBJECTIVE: To present a case of C_D015725-associated D_D016171 (D_D016171) and discuss C_D015725's role in causing D_D016171. 
CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed D_D016171 eight days after commencing oral C_D015725 The patient had no other risk factors for D_D016171, including D_D003324, D_D009202, D_D006333, and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of C_D015725 and D_D016171. 
The D_D016171 resolved when C_D015725 was discontinued; however, the patient continued to have D_D018879 and nonsustained D_D017180 (D_D017180) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of C_D015725 and the development of D_D016171. 
In our patient, there was no other etiology identified that could explain D_D008133 or D_D016171 The complete disappearance of D_D017180 and D_D018879 followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests C_D015725 as the etiology. 
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that C_D015725, even at low doses, may cause D_D008133, leading to D_D016171. 
In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute C_D000305 D_D009135 that high-dose C_D008775 may cause. 
In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute C_D000305 D_D009135 that high-dose C_D008775 may cause. 
Further, C_D013256 D_D009135 recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the C_D013256 D_D009135, instead of any protection that C_D008775 offers to the D_D013119. 
To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the C_D008775 recommended by NASCIS may cause acute C_D000305 D_D009135. 
To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the C_D008775 recommended by NASCIS may cause acute C_D000305 D_D009135. 
OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of C_D014331 and C_D010862; C_D012601-induced D_D008569. 
Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater C_D012601-induced D_D008569 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05). 
C_D000086-induced D_D005862. 
We report a case of C_D000086-induced D_D005862 in a patient with normal renal function, to highlight predisposing factors that are frequently overlooked. 
D_D001714-like syndrome induced by C_C076029. 
We report a female patient with a diagnosis of a not otherwise specified D_D011618 (DSM-IV) who developed D_D001714 shortly after the introduction of C_C076029 treatment. 
In the present study, C_D010100 radical production in patients with D_D017114 due to C_D000082 D_D062787 was compared with that of healthy volunteers. 
These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in D_D017114 due to C_D000082 D_D062787, that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement, possibly connected to the complement receptor. 
Absence of effect of C_D020280 on time-based sensitization of D_D003072 with C_D006220. 
RESULTS: D_D003072 was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of C_D006220 on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing. 
CONCLUSION: C_D006220 produced a clear profile of D_D003072 that was not worsened by concomitant C_D020280 administration. 
Five patients with D_D009369 who developed D_D058186 that followed treatment with C_D002939 are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed. 
An improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of C_D002939-induced D_D058186. 
C_D010419 has been associated with D_D017180, including D_D016171. 
C_D010419-induced D_D016171 may be related to serum C_D008274 levels and D_C537153 may synergistically induce torsade. 
D_D016171 occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with C_D010419. 
D_D016171 can be treated when recognized early, possibly without discontinuation of C_D010419. 
Time dependence of plasma C_D008315, C_-1, and C_D009705 during incomplete D_D002545 in the rat. 
Increased plasma C_D008315 was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor C_D001241 intravenously immediately before D_D007511, the other receiving 650 micrograms/kg b.w. of the D_D007022 drug C_D009599 at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during D_D007511, although in this latter group C_D008315 was significantly higher. 
A patient developed a severe cholinergic syndrome from the use of C_D004456 ophthalmic drops, presented with profound D_D018908 and was initially given the diagnosis of D_D009157. 
D_D058186 in high dose C_D016190 chemotherapy. 
C_D016190 has been reported to cause D_D058186 when administered in high doses to adult patients. 
She had D_D010049 after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for D_D006689, and received exogenous C_D004967, a treatment implicated in the development of D_D016889 in menopausal women. 
Young women on replacement C_D004967 for D_D010049 after D_D009369 therapy may also have increased risk of D_D016889 and should be examined periodically. 
Induction of the D_D020181 in a woman by exogenous C_D000728 administration. 
We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the D_D020181 while being administered exogenous C_D000728s. 
A rechallenge with C_D000728 produced symptoms of D_D020181 that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. 
Development of the D_D020181 must be considered a possible side effect of C_D000728 therapy. 
Effect of C_D002216 on pre-existing and C_D011692-induced D_D011507 in spontaneously D_D006973 rats. 
Also, C_D002216 treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive D_D011507 invoked by puromycin C_D011692 in SHR. 
In one patient, C_D004737 administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor D_D012640. 
D_D004827 foci delineated and activated by C_D004737 were surgically ablated and the patients are now D_D012640-free. 
Reversible D_D001927 associated with C_C033706 usage: MR demonstration. 
Enhanced stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow in C_D004837-induced D_D006973 rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation. 
We used C_D002738 or hydroxyC_D002738 in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of D_D012164 attributable to these drugs. 
D_D014869 associated with C_D010121 administration during saline-induced D_D000031. 
Four cases of D_D014869 in connection with C_D010121 administration during saline-induced D_D000031s are described. 
C_D010121 administration during midtrimester-induced D_D000031s is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of D_D014869 and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as D_D001247, muscular D_D001523, or D_D006261.
