Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in C_D005283-induced D_D009127 in the rat. 
Whereas D_D009127 is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose C_D005283 anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). 
Such an induced D_D009127 by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, C_D011224. 
It is speculated that the induction of D_D009127 by C_D005283 may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.

Long-term prognosis for transplant-free survivors of C_D000082-induced D_D017114. 
BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant-free survivors of C_D000082-induced D_D017114 remains unknown. 
AIM: To examine whether C_D000082-induced D_D017114 increases long-term mortality. 
METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of C_D000082-induced D_D056486, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. 
On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose C_D000082-induced D_D056486 had caused an D_D017114 (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of D_D017114 died of D_D008107, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups.

Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the C_D0127016 gene (HTR6) with C_D008694-induced D_D011605. 
C_D008694OD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 C_D008694-induced D_D011605 patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. 
RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with C_D008694-induced D_D011605 patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. 
In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and C_D008694-induced D_D011605 patients, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of C_D008694-induced D_D011605 in the Japanese population.

Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on C_D016642-induced D_D012640 in mice. 
BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of C_D016642-induced D_D012640. 
METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg, a known D_D012640 dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of C_D016642-induced D_D012640 in the Swiss albino mice. 
RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced D_D012640 in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1. 
Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of C_D016642 HCl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of D_D012640 at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection. 
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and D_D012640 dose of C_D016642 and the risk of D_D012640 in a prospective study is novel.

Detailed spectral profile analysis of C_D010406-induced D_D004827 in anesthetized rats. 
C_D010406 model is a widely used experimental model for D_D004827 research. 
In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of C_D010406-induced D_D004827 in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats. 
After a short period of basal activity recording, D_D004827 focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl C_D010406-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. 
Basal activity, latent period and the C_D010406-induced D_D004827 periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis.

D_D051437 was defined as a rise in serum C_D003404 >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. 
We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline C_D003404, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of D_D006973, D_D003920, and use of antiplatelet, C_D004232, and beta-blocker therapy.

BACKGROUND: C_D010389 is an C_C064210 derivative that is structurally different from C_D000662 and used in the treatment of D_D001289. 
C_D010389 has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute D_D009069. 
The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with C_D010389 who experienced profound D_D002819|D001264. 
The children had a medical history significant for D_D001289 previously treated with C_D008774 without success. 
The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous C_D001569 in an attempt to control the D_D002819|D001264 movements. 
CONCLUSION: C_D010389 associated D_D009069 has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature. 
The possibility of D_D002819|D001264 movements should be considered in patients presenting after C_D010389 D_D062787.

Risk of D_D007674 after consumption of nonionic C_D003287 by children undergoing cardiac angiography: a prospective study. 
Despite increasing reports on nonionic C_D003287-induced D_D007674 (D_D007674) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures, the studies in pediatrics are limited, with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography. 
This prospective study determined the incidence of D_D007674 for two nonionic C_D003287 (C_D003287), C_C038192 and C_D007472, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of C_D003287 and the presence of D_D003490.

Whereas 33.3% of the patients with D_D007674 were among those who received the proper dosage of C_D003287, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of D_D007674 related to the different dosages of C_D003287 (p = 0.014). 
The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic C_D003287, nor on the presence of D_D003490, and although D_D007674 usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.

PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of D_D009410 in C_D004977-induced D_D009901 using optical coherence tomography (OCT). 
C_D004977 is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat D_D014376. 
A serious complication of C_D004977 is an D_D009901 that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. 
METHODS: Three subjects with a history of C_D004977 (C_D004977)-induced D_D009901 of short-, intermediate-, and long-term D_D014786 were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination. 
METHODS: Three subjects with a history of C_D004977 (C_D004977)-induced D_D009901 of short-, intermediate-, and long-term D_D014786 were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination. 
In all subjects with history of C_D004977-induced D_D009901, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant (patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate D_D014786, 68% loss; patient C, with chronic D_D014786, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26+/-16 microm.

CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with C_D004977-induced D_D009901 show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers. 
Additionally, in terms of management of C_D004977-induced D_D009901, it is important to properly manage C_D004977 dosing in patients with D_D051437 and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached.

Few cases of drug-induced D_D006606 have been reported related to C_D018942 antimicrobials. 
Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other C_D018942s and the absence of any alternative explanation for D_D006606. 
Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by C_D017963 could be the pathogenesis of D_D006606 in our patient. 
However, C_D018942 antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with D_D006606 and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side-effect.

C_D005996 induces attacks of D_D020326 in sufferers of D_D020325. 
C_D005996 induces attacks of D_D020326 in sufferers of D_D020325. 
In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule C_D009569 (C_D009569) is involved in D_D010146 mechanisms of D_D020326. 
In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule C_D009569 (C_D009569) is involved in D_D010146 mechanisms of D_D020326. 
In order to clarify whether the same is true for D_D020325, in the present study we examined the D_D006261 response to intravenous infusion of C_D005996 (C_D005996) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of D_D020325.

In the controls, the C_D005996-induced D_D006261 gradually disappeared, whereas in D_D008881 peak D_D006261 intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion.

Prevention of D_D001943 with C_D013629: preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women. 
BACKGROUND: C_D013629 is a candidate chemopreventive agent in D_D001943, although the drug may be associated with the development of D_D016889. 
BACKGROUND: C_D013629 is a candidate chemopreventive agent in D_D001943, although the drug may be associated with the development of D_D016889. 
METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of C_D013629 in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have D_D001943 and who had had a hysterectomy. 
There is no difference in D_D001943 frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and C_D013629 (19) arms. 
There is a statistically significant reduction of D_D001943 among women receiving C_D013629 who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of D_D001943 compared with one case among 362 women allocated to C_D013629. 
Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of D_D014652 and D_D015228 among women on C_D013629. 
Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of D_D014652 and D_D015228 among women on C_D013629. 
INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of D_D001943, the postulated protective effects of C_D013629 are not yet apparent.

Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of C_D004967-induced rat D_D010911 may mediate C_D004967-initiated D_D009369 angiogenesis. 
Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of C_D004967-induced rat D_D010911 may mediate C_D004967-initiated D_D009369 angiogenesis. 
C_D004967, which have been associated with several types of human and animal D_D009369, can induce D_D009369 angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats. 
The mechanistic details of D_D009369 angiogenesis induction, during C_D004967 D_D063646, are still unknown. 
The mechanistic details of D_D009369 angiogenesis induction, during C_D004967 D_D063646, are still unknown. 
To elucidate the role of C_D004967 in the regulation of D_D009369 angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. 
The high D_D009369 angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the C_D004958 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. 
These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR-2) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of C_D004967 induced D_D009369 angiogenesis in the rat pituitary.

C_D012254 is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of D_D018357, and orally in combination with interferon to treat D_D006526. 
Intravenous C_D012254 is the treatment of choice for D_D006482. 
The most common adverse effect of intravenous C_D012254 is reversible mild D_D000740. 
The use of C_C059262 in severe D_D000257 has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is D_D007674. 
The use of C_C059262 in severe D_D000257 has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is D_D007674. 
OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous C_D012254 therapy for severe D_D000257 in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. 
DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous C_D012254 for documented severe D_D000257. 
Use of C_C059262 in 1 child was associated with D_D058186 and D_D009503. 
Use of C_C059262 in 1 child was associated with D_D058186 and D_D009503. 
Although intravenous C_D012254 was not effective for all children with severe D_D000257 in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the D_D007239. 
Although intravenous C_D012254 was not effective for all children with severe D_D000257 in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the D_D007239. 
CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe D_D000257 treated with intravenous C_D012254 recovered. 
Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of D_D000257 in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous C_D012254, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.

Latency to the loss of righting reflex, D_D009127 and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of C_D007649 or C_D009020 in each combination. 
Latency to the loss of righting reflex, D_D009127 and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of C_D007649 or C_D009020 in each combination. 
C_D009270 inhibited the induced D_D002375 effects. 
While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced D_D002375, differences in latency, D_D009127 and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for C_D009270 would argue against an action at a single opioid site.

Effects of C_D000588 pretreatment on ketC_D000588 D_D002389 in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals. 
The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholC_D000588s and pineal idolC_D000588s on ketC_D000588-induced D_D002389 in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. 
In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopC_D000588 increased the duration of D_D002389 (DOC) after ketC_D000588, but pretreatment with C_D009638 did not. 
In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopC_D000588 increased the duration of D_D002389 (DOC) after ketC_D000588, but pretreatment with C_D009638 did not. 
Furthermore, dopC_D000588 appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketC_D000588 D_D002389 rather than directly on the pituitary.

Prolonged D_D010243 due to C_D003473 and C_D000305. 
The long-term use of C_D003473 (C_D003473) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged D_D018908, although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear. 
We report 3 patients (age 37-52 years) with acute D_D012131 who developed prolonged D_D018908 following the discontinuation of C_D003473s.

Diuretics, C_D011188 and D_D001145 in D_D006973 D_D003327. 
It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma C_D011188 can alter the tendency towards cardiac D_D001145. 
Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential D_D006973 and known D_D003324 after 8 weeks of treatment with a C_D011188-conserving diuretic (C_D000584) and a similar period on a C_D011188-losing diuretic (C_D002752) in a randomised study.

Compared to C_D000584 treatment, the C_D002752 phase was associated with an increased frequency of D_D018879 (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation.

The above results indicate that because C_D011188-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with D_D017202, even minor falls in plasma C_D011188 concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.

Swallowing-induced D_D013617 triggered by C_D000420: case report and review of the literature. 
The D_D001145 resolved after therapy with C_D001262, but recurred a year later. 
After stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the C_D001262, the D_D001145 disappeared. 
CONCLUSION: C_D000420 is presented here as a possible trigger for D_D013617. 
Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like C_D000420 (known to induce D_D013610) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as C_D001262 (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.

Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to C_D015215-induced D_D009202. 
METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component C_D015215 (C_D015215; C_D015215) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of D_D002311, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of C_D015215 (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml). 
In contrast, C_D015215-treated FasL Tg mice developed D_D002311 and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles.

C_C052342-induced D_D053040. 
C_C052342 is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating D_D004827. 
In addition, a distal tubular acidification defect may result, thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH. These factors can lead to the development of C_C020243 D_D053040. 
We report the first two cases of C_C052342-induced D_D053040 in the urologic literature.

Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with C_D010862, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after C_D010862-induced D_D012640. 
Additional neuronanatomical studies, including C_C028911 staining, D_D009410 methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons was related to D_D009410 rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels.

Reversal of C_D000641 D_D003128 in rats by C_D007980: a peripheral effect. 
Reversal of C_D000641 D_D003128 in rats by C_D007980: a peripheral effect. 
C_D000641 D_D003128 was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol C_D000643. 
C_D000641 D_D003128 was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol C_D000643. 
This D_D003128 was prevented with 1.68 mmol C_D007980 given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the C_D064751 injection. 
This D_D003128 was prevented with 1.68 mmol C_D007980 given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the C_D064751 injection. 
Intraventricular infusion of C_D004298 sufficient to raise the brain C_D004298 to the same extent did not prevent the C_D000641 D_D003128 nor affect the blood and brain C_D000641 concentrations. 
Intraventricular infusion of C_D004298 sufficient to raise the brain C_D004298 to the same extent did not prevent the C_D000641 D_D003128 nor affect the blood and brain C_D000641 concentrations. 
Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of C_D007980 on blood and brain C_D000641 and the C_D000641 D_D003128 was not prevented. 
Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of C_D007980 on blood and brain C_D000641 and the C_D000641 D_D003128 was not prevented. 
Thus, the reduction in blood and brain C_D000641 and the prevention of C_D000641 D_D003128 after C_D007980, can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of C_D004298 on renal function rather than its central action.

Acute D_D007674 of C_D004317 (C_D004317)-loaded C_D003487 nanoparticles. 
Acute D_D007674 of C_D004317 (C_D004317)-loaded C_D003487 nanoparticles. 
Acute C_D004317-loaded nanoparticle (C_D004317NP) D_D007674 was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental D_D005921. 
Acute C_D004317-loaded nanoparticle (C_D004317NP) D_D007674 was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental D_D005921. 
A 3 times higher D_D011507 appeared in animals treated with C_D004317NP than in those treated with C_D004317. 
In rats with immune experimental D_D005921, 5/6 rats given C_D004317 died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by C_D004317NP, NP, or untreated, which all survived. 
D_D011507 appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after C_D004317 treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between C_D004317NP and C_D004317. 
These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, C_D004317NP killed less animals than free C_D004317, despite of an enhanced D_D007674 of the former. 
Both effects (better survival and D_D009401) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of C_D004317NP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.

Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of D_D009404 induced in the rat by C_D011692. 
This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in D_D009404 induced by C_D011692 were due to D_D009404 per se, or, at least in part, to the C_D011692. 
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of C_D011692 (20 mg/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of D_D009404. 
In pre-D_D009404 stage the plasma level of C_D005227, C_D014280 and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, C_D002788 and HDL remained constant.

Mechanisms of D_D017202 induced by C_D004837: comparison with exercise-induced D_D007511. 
The role of C_D004837 in eliciting D_D017202 was examined in patients with D_D003324. 
The role of C_D004837 in eliciting D_D017202 was examined in patients with D_D003324. 
Objective signs of D_D007511 and factors increasing myocardial C_D010100 consumption were compared during C_D004837 infusion and supine bicycle exercise. 
Objective signs of D_D007511 and factors increasing myocardial C_D010100 consumption were compared during C_D004837 infusion and supine bicycle exercise. 
Both C_D004837 and exercise produced D_D017202 as evidenced by ST segment D_D003866 and D_D000787. 
Both C_D004837 and exercise produced D_D017202 as evidenced by ST segment D_D003866 and D_D000787. 
Both C_D004837 and exercise produced D_D017202 as evidenced by ST segment D_D003866 and D_D000787. 
However, the mechanisms of D_D017202 induced by C_D004837 were significantly different from those of exercise. 
Exercise-induced D_D017202 was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while C_D004837-induced D_D007511 was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. 
Exercise-induced D_D017202 was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while C_D004837-induced D_D007511 was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. 
These findings indicate that D_D007511 produced by C_D004837, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion.

Transient D_D009069 following unilateral D_-1 reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by C_D000661. 
Following unilateral C_D016627 induced D_-1, a transient period of D_D009069 has been reported to precede the predominant D_D009069. 
In order to clarify the nature of this initial D_D009069 we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on C_D000661-induced D_D009069. 
A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when C_D000661 was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the D_D009069. 
However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, C_D000661 dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), C_D000661-induced D_D009069 tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further C_D000661 injections. 
These findings suggest that C_D000661 has an irreversible effect on the post-lesion DA pool contributing to D_D009069.

The D_D000740 induced by C_D015215 (C_D015215) is poorly understood. 
We have used a murine model of D_D000163, D_D007239 of female C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine D_D007938 (MuLV) virus, to determine if C_D015215-induced D_D000740 is due, in part, to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors (BFU-e) to erythropoietin (EPO).

C_D015215 produced D_D000740 in both groups, in a dose-dependent fashion. 
Despite the D_D000740, the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU-e in C_D015215 treated mice increased up to five-fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment. 
The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in C_D015215 treated mice were appropriate for the degree of D_D000740 observed when compared with C_C030299 (C_C030299) treated mice.

Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in C_D004317-induced D_D009202 with C_D019797. 
Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in C_D004317-induced D_D009202 with C_D019797. 
Using a rat model of C_D004317-induced D_D009202, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in C_D004317 D_D009202. 
The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight D_D009202 (scattered or focal D_C536522) indicates that C_D019797 scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of C_D004317-induced D_D009202.

D_D007024 occurs following alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade in chronic C_D011224-pretreated conscious spontaneously D_D006973 rats. 
D_D007024 occurs following alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade in chronic C_D011224-pretreated conscious spontaneously D_D006973 rats. 
Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic C_D011224 treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously D_D006973 rats (SHR). 
However, the head-up tilt induced D_D007024 in the SHR treated with C_D011224 (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with C_D015016 (less than +2% MAP, n = 6).

C_C051883 suppresses D_D006962 without inducing D_D001851 in dogs with D_D051437. 
BACKGROUND: C_D002117 therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with D_D051437 but has several drawbacks, including D_D006934 and/or marked D_D001851, which may lead to D_D001851.

BACKGROUND: C_D002117 therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with D_D051437 but has several drawbacks, including D_D006934 and/or marked D_D001851, which may lead to D_D001851. 
This study was undertaken to determine the effects of C_C051883 on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or D_D007674. 
RESULTS: In Nx dogs, C_C051883 significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of D_D051437. 
In long-standing D_D006962, C_C051883 (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months. 
These effects were accompanied by episodes of D_D006934 and hyperC_D010710mia. 
In Nx dogs, C_C051883 reversed abnormal bone formation, such as D_-1 and D_D005355, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover. 
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though C_C051883 does not completely prevent the occurrence of D_D006934 in experimental dogs with D_D051437, it may be of use in the management of D_D006962 because it does not induce D_D001851 and, therefore, does not increase the risk of D_D001851.

Chemotherapy of advanced inoperable D_D002289 with C_D017239: a phase II trial. 
C_D017239 (C_D017239; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different D_D009369 types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma. 
Two phase II trials of 24-hour C_D017239 infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV D_D002289 (D_D002289) reported response rates of 21% and 24%. 
We investigated the efficacy and D_D064420 of a 3-hour C_D017239 infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV D_D002289. 
We investigated the efficacy and D_D064420 of a 3-hour C_D017239 infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV D_D002289. 
C_D017239 is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic D_D064420. 
Further phase II studies with C_D017239 combined with other drugs active against D_D002289 are indicated, and phase III studies comparing C_D017239 with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed.

D_D002543 associated with C_D010665 in combination with C_D002110. 
C_D010665 (C_D010665) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including D_D020521. 
In order to determine if C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D020521 in normotensive and/or D_D006973 rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days. 
In order to determine if C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D020521 in normotensive and/or D_D006973 rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days. 
A single C_D010665/C_D002110 administration (same dose) lead to acute D_D006973 in both the normotensive and D_D006973 animals. 
These results suggest that C_D010665/C_D002110 can lead to D_D002543 in previously D_D006973 animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage.

Long-term efficacy and D_D064420 of high-dose C_D000638 therapy for D_D017180 or D_D014693. 
C_D000638 was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic D_D017180 (D_D017180) (n = 118) or a D_D006323 (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. 
C_D000638 was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic D_D017180 (D_D017180) (n = 118) or a D_D006323 (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. 
Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with C_D000638 and had no recurrence of symptomatic D_D017180 or D_D014693 (D_D014693) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). 
Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with C_D000638 and had no recurrence of symptomatic D_D017180 or D_D014693 (D_D014693) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). 
Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of D_D017180 and were successfully managed by continuing C_D000638 at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug. 
Although large-dose C_D000638 is highly effective in the long-term treatment of D_D017180 or D_D014693 refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant D_D064420 in approximately 50% of patients.

Effect of C_D002122 and C_D015761 therapy on C_D003891 D_D064420 in rats. 
This study addressed the potential role of C_D002118 channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced D_D007022. 
METHODS: Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with C_D002118 channel blocker D_D062787. 
Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant C_D003891 IP to produce D_D007022, QRS prolongation, and D_D001919. 
Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant C_D003891 IP to produce D_D007022, QRS prolongation, and D_D001919. 
RESULTS: C_D017693 briefly (5 min) reversed D_D007022 and QRS prolongation. 
The incidence of D_D001145 (p = 0.004) and D_D012640 (p = 0.03) in the C_D002122 group was higher than the other groups. 
The incidence of D_D001145 (p = 0.004) and D_D012640 (p = 0.03) in the C_D002122 group was higher than the other groups. 
CONCLUSION: The administration of C_D002122 or C_D015761 did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced D_D007022 in rats. 
CONCLUSION: The administration of C_D002122 or C_D015761 did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced D_D007022 in rats. 
C_D002122 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system D_D064420. 
These findings do not support a role for C_D002118 channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced D_D007022.

Dual effects of C_D008550 on C_C032232-induced D_D053608 in rats. 
Dual effects of C_D008550 on C_C032232-induced D_D053608 in rats. 
C_D008550 affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced D_D053608. 
C_D008550 pre-treatment affected in a dual manner C_C032232 D_D053608, however, no dose-effect correlation was found. 
C_D008550 pre-treatment affected in a dual manner C_C032232 D_D053608, however, no dose-effect correlation was found. 
In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of C_C032232 D_D053608. 
In contrast, the highest dose of C_D008550 (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of D_D053608, and a reduction in mortality rate. 
C_D008550 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of C_D007649- or C_D003975-induced D_D053608. 
C_D008550 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of C_D007649- or C_D003975-induced D_D053608. 
C_D008550 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of C_D007649- or C_D003975-induced D_D053608. 
Thus, the dual action of C_D008550 on pharmacological D_D053608 seems to be specific for the C_C032232 mechanism of action.

D_-1 and D_D002761 related to long-term C_D010634 therapy: an autopsy report of two patients. 
C_D010634 (C_D010634) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that C_D010634-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic D_D008107. 
Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of D_D004827 treated with C_D010634 who died suddenly: one as consequence of D_D006323, the other of acute D_D001996.

Effects of C_D014700 on D_D001281 and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs. 
BACKGROUND: D_D013617-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of D_D001281 (D_D001281) and decreases L-type C_D002118(2+) current. 
BACKGROUND: D_D013617-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of D_D001281 (D_D001281) and decreases L-type C_D002118(2+) current. 
There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type C_D002118(2) channel blockade can promote D_D001281, consistent with an D_D001281 promoting effect of C_D002118(2+) channel inhibition. 
METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of D_D001281 promotion by C_D002118(2+) channel blockers, we administered C_D014700 to C_D009020-C_D002698 anesthetized dogs. 
METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of D_D001281 promotion by C_D002118(2+) channel blockers, we administered C_D014700 to C_D009020-C_D002698 anesthetized dogs. 
METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of D_D001281 promotion by C_D002118(2+) channel blockers, we administered C_D014700 to C_D009020-C_D002698 anesthetized dogs. 
RESULTS: C_D014700 caused D_D001281 promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of D_D001281 induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. 
In these experiments, C_D014700 shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of D_D001281 (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005). 
C_D004110 did not affect ERP, D_D001281 cycle length or D_D001281 duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by C_D014700 (n=5). 
C_D004110 did not affect ERP, D_D001281 cycle length or D_D001281 duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by C_D014700 (n=5). 
In the presence of autonomic blockade, C_D014700 failed to promote D_D001281 and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. 
Epicardial mapping suggested that C_D014700 promoted D_D001281 by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D014700 promotes D_D001281 in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by C_D004110.

D_D056486 were quantified as serum activities of C_D018698-C_D062907 transaminase (GOT) and C_D018698-C_D019289 transaminase (GPT). 
In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of C_D000082, and unlike the exacerbation caused by C_D000431 in mice on a standard diet, the D_D056486 was inhibited by 50% by C_D000431.

The concentration for C_D004837-induced D_D001145 was significantly higher than those for the other types of D_D001145s. 
Because C_C032151 had only weak D_D007022 and sinus node D_D003866 effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation D_D001145 dogs, its clinical usefulness is expected.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels during C_D009569-induced D_D006261 in patients with chronic tension-type D_D006261. 
It has been proposed that C_D009569 (C_D009569) induced D_D006261 in primary D_D006261s may be associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). 
In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during D_D006261 induced by the C_D009569 donor C_D005996 (C_D005996) in 16 patients with chronic tension-type D_D006261 and 16 healthy controls. 
In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during D_D006261 induced by the C_D009569 donor C_D005996 (C_D005996) in 16 patients with chronic tension-type D_D006261 and 16 healthy controls. 
The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 microg/kg/min C_D005996 or placebo over 20 min on two D_D006261-free days. 
Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate D_D006261 on the C_D005996 day than on the placebo day and the D_D006261 was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls. 
The present study indicates that C_D009569-induced immediate D_D006261 is not associated with release of CGRP.

C_D009569 synthase expression in the course of C_D007854-induced D_D006973. 
We recently showed elevated reactive C_D010100 species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of C_D009569 metabolites (C_D009569x), and increased C_D009569 sequestration as C_C002744 in various tissues in rats with C_D007854-induced D_D006973.

This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary C_D009569x in C_D007854-induced D_D006973 is, in part, due to depressed C_D009569 synthase (C_D009569S) expression.

In conclusion, C_D007854-induced D_D006973 in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eC_D009569S and iC_D009569S expression. 
In conclusion, C_D007854-induced D_D006973 in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eC_D009569S and iC_D009569S expression. 
This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated C_D009569 inactivation, C_D007854-associated inhibition of C_D009569S activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with D_D006973.

Risk for D_D006349 among users of C_D005277 and dexC_D005277 who underwent echocardiography before use of medication. 
BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of C_D005277 and dexC_D005277 had D_D006349, these drugs were withdrawn from the market. 
OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening D_D006349 among users of C_D005277 or dexC_D005277 who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications.

However, the use of C_D016190 higher-intensity schedules and the association with other D_D020258 drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to D_D010523. 
However, the use of C_D016190 higher-intensity schedules and the association with other D_D020258 drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to D_D010523. 
RESULTS: C_D016190 administration induced dose-dependent peripheral D_D020258ity. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D016190 is D_D020258 in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by C_D002945 that it is probable that D_D020258ity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.

D_D066126 and possible leukemogenic effects of C_D004317 in nonhuman primates. 
8 of the 10 monkeys developed D_D006333 at an average cumulative C_D004317 dose (310 mg/m2) well below that considered the safe upper limit (550 mg/m2) in man. 
Histologically, the D_D001768 resembled those found in human C_D018943-induced D_D009202. 
Histologically, the D_D001768 resembled those found in human C_D018943-induced D_D009202. 
1 of the 10 monkeys developed D_D015470 after receiving 324 mg/m2 of C_D004317; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug. 
Our results suggest that C_D004317 is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man, and that D_D007938 may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug.

Although there have been anecdotal reports of D_D066126 associated with C_D005472 (C_D005472) therapy, this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion. 
We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing C_D005472 infusion for treatment of solid D_D009369 in order to assess the incidence of D_D007511 ST changes. 
We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing C_D005472 infusion for treatment of solid D_D009369 in order to assess the incidence of D_D007511 ST changes. 
D_D000787 episodes were rare: only one patient had D_D000787 (during C_D005472 infusion). 
The incidence of D_D007511 episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to C_D005472 infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during C_D005472 infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before C_D005472 v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during C_D005472 (P less than .01). 
We conclude that C_D005472 infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of D_D007511, particularly among patients with D_D003324.

Mice lacking mC_D011453ES-1 are resistant to C_D008094-induced D_D011141. 
Cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of C_D008094-induced D_D011141.

day(-1) ip) in mC_D011453ES-1 +/+ mice led to a marked D_D011141 with hyposmotic urine. 
In contrast, mC_D011453ES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to C_D008094-induced D_D011141 and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine C_D011453E(2) and cAMP output.

Clinical use of the C_D018943 C_D004317 (C_D004317) is limited by its D_D066126 effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis. 
To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) during the development of C_D004317 D_D009202, we studied B1R knockout mice (B1R(-/-)) by investigating cardiac D_D007249 and apoptosis after induction of C_D004317-induced D_D009202. 
To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) during the development of C_D004317 D_D009202, we studied B1R knockout mice (B1R(-/-)) by investigating cardiac D_D007249 and apoptosis after induction of C_D004317-induced D_D009202. 
C_D004317 control mice showed D_D006331 measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo. 
In C_D004317 B1R(-/-) mice, D_D006331 was improved compared to C_D004317 control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state. 
These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in C_D004317 D_D009202 in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis. 
These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B1R antagonists for treatment of human C_D004317 D_D009202.

D_D056486 associated with C_D012460 in inflammatory D_D001168: A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events. 
Patients', who had D_D056486 on C_D012460 and met a definition of a serious ADR, were identified. 
The likely frequency of D_D056486 with C_D012460 was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions. 
The likely frequency of serious D_D056486 with C_D012460 was estimated at 0.4% of treated patients. 
CONCLUSION: Serious D_D056486 associated with C_D012460 appears to be under-appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the D_D007674 effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, C_C044834, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, C_D007472. 
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the D_D007674 effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, C_C044834, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, C_D007472. 
The study involved 129 patients with D_D003920 with serum C_D003404 concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. 
CONCLUSIONS: D_D007674 induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when C_C044834 is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.

D_D009459 with C_D018967. 
D_D009459 is thought to be a result of C_D004298 D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia. 
The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of D_D001480 with C_D018967 at low dosages. 
A 73-year-old woman developed D_D009459 after monotherapy with C_D018967. 
It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with C_D018967 does not ensure protection from D_D009459.

Hepatic and extrahepatic C_D000809ogen gene expression in rats with acute D_D009404. 
Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin-C_D000809 system proteins are altered in rats with D_D009404 (D_D009404). 
In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of C_D000809ogen (Ao) were analyzed with the slot-blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues: kidney, heart, brain, and adrenal gland from control, D_D009404, and pair-fed (PF) rats. 
D_D009404 was induced by a single injection of C_D011692 (C_D011692). 
Although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after C_D011692 injection, when D_D009404 was clearly established, hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change. 
These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute D_D009404 induced by C_D011692.

Acute blood pressure elevations with C_D002110 in men with borderline systemic D_D006973. 
Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of C_D002110 are enhanced in D_D006973 persons has not been demonstrated. 
Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved D_D006973 BP levels after C_D002110 ingestion. 
Thus, in borderline D_D006973 men, exaggerated responses to C_D002110 were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline D_D006973s.

Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged C_D007530-induced D_D007022 in humans. 
The effect of C_D007530-induced D_D007022 on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects. 
D_D007022 was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the C_D007530 inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg. 
We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during C_D007530-induced D_D007022 and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.

Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that C_C045894 has activity against D_D009369 which are refractory to other drugs, notably C_D008727. 
Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that C_C045894 has activity against D_D009369 which are refractory to other drugs, notably C_D008727. 
However, the initial clinical development of C_C045894 was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative D_D064420. 
Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the D_D064420 of C_C045894 can be prevented by low dose C_D005492 administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose.

BACKGROUND: D_D000743 is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of C_D007372 and C_D012254. 
Because of C_D012254-related D_D000743, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy. 
In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of C_D012254 reduction in patients with D_D006461 during combination therapy. 
However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of C_D012254 could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or D_D000740-related severe side effects occurred (group B).

C_D003975 facilitates reflex D_D001919 in conscious rats. 
Also, reflex D_D001919 was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of C_D004837 (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1). 
Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with C_D003975, although causing no change in the C_D004837-induced pressor effect, did enhance the C_D004837-induced reflex D_D001919.

Reduction of D_D010146 during induction with target-controlled C_D015742 and C_C071741. 
BACKGROUND: D_D010146 on injection of C_D015742 is unpleasant. 
We hypothesized that C_D015742 infusion D_D010146 might be prevented by infusing C_C071741 before starting the C_D015742 infusion in a clinical setting where target-controlled infusions (TCI) of both drugs were used.

A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine the effect-site concentration (Ce) of C_C071741 to prevent the D_D010146 without producing complications. 
C_C071741-related complications were assessed during the C_C071741 infusion, and D_D010146 caused by C_D015742 was evaluated using a four-point scale during the C_D015742 infusion.

Prenatal exposure to C_D005473 induces fetal D_D006976 in the rat. 
Epidemiological data suggest that C_D005473 exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent D_D006976 of the newborn. 
The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a D_D006976 protective C_D005473 effect in adult rodents. 
As compared with controls, C_D005473 exposure resulted in fetal D_D006976 as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the adult, C_D005473 exposure in utero induces D_D006976 in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation.

The association between opioid dose and QT, and C_D008691 dose and reporting of D_D013575 was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. 
Among the subjects treated with C_D008691, 28% men and 32% women had D_D008133. 
A 50 mg higher C_D008691 dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for D_D013575. 
CONCLUSIONS: C_D008691 is associated with D_D008133 and higher reporting of D_D013575 in a population of C_D003932 addicts.

D_D010523 caused by high-dose C_D003561 treatment in a patient with D_D015470. 
D_D010523 caused by high-dose C_D003561 treatment in a patient with D_D015470. 
The central nervous system D_D064420 of high-dose C_D003561 is well recognized, but the D_D064420 of C_D003561 in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported. 
The first course of high-dose C_D003561 resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of D_D006987 in his right foot. 
This D_D009422 was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of D_D006086, and the symptoms subsequently responded to C_D008775. 
This D_D009422 was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of D_D006086, and the symptoms subsequently responded to C_D008775. 
Although the mechanisms of D_D010523 are still unclear, high-dose C_D003561 is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms.

Erythropoietin restores the D_D000740-induced reduction in C_D003520 D_D064420 in rat D_D009369. 
The aim of this study was to examine the impact of D_D000740 prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the D_D064420 of C_D003520 in solid experimental D_D009369.

D_D000740 was induced using a single dose of C_D016190 (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration. 
In a second group, the development of D_D000740 was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before C_D016190 application. 
Four days after C_D016190 treatment, D_D009369 (DS-D_D012509 of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. 
Four days after C_D016190 treatment, D_D009369 (DS-D_D012509 of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. 
Neither C_D016190 nor rHuEPO treatment influenced D_D009369 growth rate per se. 
When D_D009369 were treated with a single dose of C_D003520 (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the D_D009369 was observed. 
These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced D_D000740 reduces D_D064420 of C_D003520 in D_D009369, whereas correction of D_D000740 by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved C_D010100 supply to D_D009369 tissue.

CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high-dose C_D014148 in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical D_D012640 in susceptible patients.

Increased D_D003072 associated with the APOE epsilon4 allele after C_D014282 oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly. 
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon4 and subjective effects of C_D014282 on measures reflecting sedation and D_D003221 and to investigate the relationship between C_D014282-induced subjective effects and objective memory performance. 
RESULTS: A 2.0-mg oral dose of C_D014282 resulted in increased subjective ratings of D_D003072 in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only. 
Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2.0 mg C_D014282 and placebo on ratings of D_D003072 significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only. 
CONCLUSION: The epsilon4 allele in healthy elderly was associated with increased subjective D_D003072 after C_D014282 anticholinergic challenge.

D_D006323 after intravenous C_D008787 - a case of five repeated injections of C_D008787 causing five episodes of D_D006323. 
We describe a patient where intravenous injection of C_D008787 was immediately followed by D_D006323 repeatedly. 
After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation, it is clear that every administration of C_D008787 was immediately (within s) followed by D_D006323. 
We interpret this as episodes of D_D006323 caused by C_D008787.

Cortical motor overactivation in D_D020734 patients with C_D007980-induced peak-dose D_D004409. 
Cortical motor overactivation in D_D020734 patients with C_D007980-induced peak-dose D_D004409. 
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of D_D020734 patients on C_D007980 medication, the first one without C_D007980 induced D_D004409 (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose D_D004409 (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects. 
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of D_D020734 patients on C_D007980 medication, the first one without C_D007980 induced D_D004409 (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose D_D004409 (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects. 
These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an D_D006948 D_D004409, like C_D007980-induced peak dose D_D004409, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.

C_D003907-induced D_D009798 in perfusion-cultured human eyes. 
In contrast, the C_D003907-treated D_D009798 had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm. 
CONCLUSION: C_D003907 treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of D_D009798 in approximately 30% of the C_D003907-treated eyes. 
C_D013256 treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for D_D005901 and D_D005902.

Delayed-onset C_D006493-induced D_D013921. 
BACKGROUND: C_D006493-induced D_D013921 presents 5 to 12 days after C_D006493 exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. 
Delayed recognition and treatment of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 contribute to poor patient outcomes. 
OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 are delayed. 
PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom C_D006493-induced D_D013921 became apparent on delayed presentation with D_D013923 complications. 
PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom C_D006493-induced D_D013921 became apparent on delayed presentation with D_D013923 complications. 
MEASUREMENTS: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined D_D013923, results of C_D006493-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes. 
RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included C_D006493 exposure--in most cases, with no D_D013921 recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with D_D013923 complications.

C_D001241 (C_D001241 [C_D001241]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces D_D000014 when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11 (Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ. 
Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when C_D001241 is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal D_D005767 confounds the detection of low incidence D_D000014 with C_D001241 when a multiple dosing paradigm is used.

RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce D_D006345 (D_D006345) and D_D009436 (D_D009436) in rats and D_D065630 (D_D065630), D_D009436, and D_D006345 in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these D_D000014, even though C_D001241 induces several other low-incidence D_D000014. 
RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce D_D006345 (D_D006345) and D_D009436 (D_D009436) in rats and D_D065630 (D_D065630), D_D009436, and D_D006345 in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these D_D000014, even though C_D001241 induces several other low-incidence D_D000014.

Variations and D_D000014 were similar when C_D001241 was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). 
It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, D_D000014 that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with C_D001241 given at multiple doses.

C_D001058: an underutilized therapy for D_D010300. 
C_D001058 was the first C_D004298rgic drug ever used to treat symptoms of D_D010300. 
C_D001058 was the first C_D004298rgic drug ever used to treat symptoms of D_D010300. 
While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating D_D010300 by subcutaneous administration of C_D001058 has only recently become the subject of systematic study. 
In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous C_D001058 infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting C_D007980-induced D_D004409. 
In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous C_D001058 infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting C_D007980-induced D_D004409. 
The main side effects of subcutaneous C_D001058 treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and D_D001523 complications play a lesser role. 
Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous C_D001058 treatment in fluctuating D_D010300, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.

Induction of the D_D020181 in a woman by exogenous C_D000728 administration. 
We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the D_D020181 while being administered exogenous C_D000728s. 
A rechallenge with C_D000728 produced symptoms of D_D020181 that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. 
Previous reports have favored a role of C_D000728s in the pathogenesis of D_D012891. 
Development of the D_D020181 must be considered a possible side effect of C_D000728 therapy.
